How does it introduce innovation into the field of distributed computing? This chapter addresses all these questions and characterizes the phenomenon. It provides a reference model that serves as a basis for discussion of cloud computing technologies. 4.1Introduction Utility-oriented data centers are the first outcome of cloud computing, and they serve as the infra structure through which the services are implemented and delivered. Any cloud service, whether virtual hardware, development platform, or application software, relies on a distributed infrastruc ture owned by the provider or rented from a third party. As noted in the previous definition, the characterization of a cloud is quite general: It can be implemented using a datacenter, a collection of clusters, or a heterogeneous distributed system composed of desktop PCs, workstations, and ser vers. Commonly, clouds are built by relying on one or more datacenters. In most cases hardware resources are virtualized to provide isolation of workloads and to best exploit the infrastructure. According to the specific service delivered to the end user, different layers can be stacked on top of the virtual infrastructure: a virtual machine manager, a development platform, or a specific appli- cation middleware. As noted in earlier chapters, the cloud computing paradigm emerged as a result of the conver- gence of various existing models, technologies, and concepts that changed the way we deliver and use IT services. A broad definition of the phenomenon could be as follows: Cloud computing is a utility-oriented and Internet-centric way of delivering IT services on demand. These services cover the entire computing stack: from the hardware infrastructure pack- aged as a set of virtual machines to software services such as development platforms and distrib- uted applications. This definition captures the most important and fundamental aspects of cloud computing. We now discuss a reference model that aids in categorization of cloud technologies, applications, and services. 111 \\n\\n112 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture 4.2 The cloud reference model Cloud computing supports any IT service that can be consumed as a utility and delivered through a network, most likely the Internet. Such characterization includes quite different aspects: infrastruc- ture, development platforms, application and services. 4.2.1 Architecture It is possible to organize all the concrete realizations of cloud computing into a layered view cover- ing the entire stack (see Figure 4.1), from hardware appliances to software systems. Cloud resources are harnessed to offer \"computing horsepower\"\\' required for providing services. Often, this layer is implemented using a datacenter in which hundreds and thousands of nodes are stacked together. Cloud infrastructure can be heterogeneous in nature because a variety of resources, such as clusters and even networked PCs, can be used to build it. Moreover, database systems and other storage services can also be part of the infrastructure. The physical infrastructure is managed by the core middleware, the objectives of which are to provide an appropriate runtime environment for applications and to best utilize resources. At the bottom of the stack, virtualization technologies are used to guarantee runtime environment customi- zation, application isolation, sandboxing, and quality of service. Hardware virtualization is most commonly used at this level. Hypervisors manage the pool of resources and expose the distributed infrastructure as a collection of virtual machines. By using virtual machine technology it is possible to finely partition the hardware resources such as CPU and memory and to virtualize specific devices, thus meeting the requirements of users and applications. This solution is generally paired  PureSaaS Cloud Applications  SaaS User Applications Social Computing, Enterprise ISV, ScientificComputing, CDNs PurePaaS Cloud Programming Environment and Tools PaaS User-level Web 2.0, Mashups, Concurrent and Distributed Programming.e  Middleware Workflows , Libraries, Scripting laaS Cloud Hosting Platforms laaS(M) QoS Negotiation, Admission ControlPricing, SLA Management, Monitoring, Execution Management, Metering, Accounting.

According to the specific service offered to end users, other virtualiza- tion techniques can be used; for example, programming-level virtualization helps in creating a portable runtime environment where applications can be run and controlled. This scenario generally implies that applications hosted in the cloud be developed with a specific technology or a program- ming language, such as Java, .NET, or Python. In this case, the user does not have to build its sys- tem from bare metal. Infrastructure management is the key function of core middleware, which supports capabilities such as negotiation of the quality of service, admission control, execution management and monitoring, accounting, and billing. The combination of cloud hosting platforms and resources is generally classified as a Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution. We can organize the different examples of IaaS into two categories: Some of them provide both the management layer and the physical infrastructure; others provide only the management layer (IaaS (M)). In this second case, the management layer is often integrated with other IaaS solutions that provide physical infrastructure and adds value to them. IaaS solutions are suitable for designing the system infrastructure but provide limited services to build applications. Such service is provided by cloud programming environments and tools which form a new layer for offering users a development platform for applications. The range of tools include Web-based interfaces, command-line tools, and frameworks for concurrent and dis- tributed programming. In this scenario, users develop their applications specifically for the cloud by using the API exposed at the user-level middleware. For this reason, this approach is also known as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) because the service offered to the user is a development platform rather than an infrastructure. PaaS solutions generally include the infrastructure as well, which is bundled as part of the service provided to users. In the case of Pure PaaS, only the user-level mid- dleware is offered, and it has to be complemented with a virtual or physical infrastructure. The top layer of the reference model depicted in Figure 4.1 contains services delivered at the application level. These are mostly referred to as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). In most cases these are Web-based applications that rely on the cloud to provide service to end users. The horsepower of the cloud provided by IaaS and PaaS solutions allows independent software vendors to deliver their application services over the Internet. Other applications belonging to this layer are those that strongly leverage the Internet for their core functionalities that rely on the cloud to sustain a larger number of users; this is the case of gaming portals and, in general, social networking websites. As a vision, any service offered in the cloud computing style should be able to adaptively change and expose an autonomic behavior, in particular for its availability and performance. As a reference model, it is then expected to have an adaptive management layer in charge of elastically scaling on demand. SaaS implementations should feature such behavior automatically, whereas PaaS and IaaS generally provide this functionality as a part of the API exposed to users. The reference model described in Figure 4.1 also introduces the concept of everything as a Service (XaaS). This is one of the most important elements of cloud computing: Cloud services from different providers can be combined to provide a completely integrated solution covering all the computing stack of a system. IaaS providers can offer the bare metal in terms of virtual machines where PaaS solutions are deployed. When there is no need for a PaaS layer, it is possible to directly customize the virtual infrastructure with the software stack needed to run applications. This is the case of virtual Web farms: a distributed system composed of Web servers, database \\n\\n114 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture. servers, and load balancers on top of which prepackaged software is installed to run Web applica tions. This possibility has made cloud computing an interesting option for reducing startups\\' capital investment in IT, allowing them to quickly commercialize their ideas and grow their infrastructure according to their revenues. Table 4.1 summarizes the characteristics of the three major categories used to classify cloud computing solutions. In the following section, we briefly discuss these characteristics along with some references to practical implementations. 4.2.2 Infrastructure- and hardware-as-a-service. Infrastructure- and Hardware-as-a-Service (IaaS/HaaS) solutions are the most popular and devel- oped market segment of cloud computing. They deliver customizable infrastructure on demand. The available options within the IaaS offering umbrella range from single servers to entire infra- structures, including network devices, load balancers, and database and Web servers. The main technology used to deliver and implement these solutions is hardware virtualization: one or more virtual machines opportunely configured and interconnected define the distributed sys- tem on top of which applications are installed and deployed. Virtual machines also constitute the atomic components that are deployed and priced according to the specific features of the virtual hardware: memory, number of processors, and disk storage. IaaS/HaaS solutions bring all the bene- fits of hardware virtualization: workload partitioning, application isolation, sandboxing, and hard- ware tuning. From the perspective of the service provider, IaaS/HaaS allows better exploiting the IT infrastructure and provides a more secure environment where executing third party applications. From the perspective of the customer it reduces the administration and maintenance cost as well as the capital costs allocated to purchase hardware. At the same time, users can take advantage of the full customization offered by virtualization to deploy their infrastructure in the cloud; in most cases virtual machines come with only the selected operating system installed and the system can be Table 4.1 Cloud Computing Services Classification.

Other solutions provide prepackaged system images that already contain the software stack required for the most common uses: Web servers, database servers, or LAMP\\' stacks. Besides the basic virtual machine management capabil- ities, additional services can be provided, generally including the following: SLA resource-based allocation, workload management, support for infrastructure design through advanced Web inter- faces, and the ability to integrate third-party IaaS solutions.. Figure 4.2 provides an overall view of the components forming an Infrastructure-as-a-Service solution. It is possible to distinguish three principal layers: the physical infrastructure, the software management infrastructure, and the user interface. At the top layer the user interface provides access to the services exposed by the software management infrastructure. Such an interface is Web-Based Management Interface Web Services, Portals, REST API Infrastructure Management Software  Pricing / Billing QoS SLA Management Scheduling  Provisioning Monitoring Reservation  VM Image Repository VM Pool Managemen Physical Infrastructure Datacenter Cluster Desktop / Heterogeneous Resourcese Third-Party laaS Cloud. FIGURE 4.2 Infrastructure-as-a-Service reference implementation. \\'LAMP is an acronym for Linux Apache MySql and PHP and identifies a specific server configuration running the Linux operating system, featuring Apache as Web server, MySQL as database server, and PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) as server-side scripting technology for developing Web applications. LAMP stacks are the most common packaged solu- tions for quickly deploying Web applications. \\n\\n116 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture generally based on Web 2.0 technologies: Web services, RESTful APIs, and mash-ups. These tech- nologies allow either applications or final users to access the services exposed by the underlying infrastructure. Web 2.0 applications allow developing full-featured management consoles completely hosted in a browser or a Web page. Web services and RESTful APIs allow programs to interact with the service without human intervention, thus providing complete integration within a software system. The core features of an IaaS solution are implemented in the infrastructure management soft- ware layer. In particular, management of the virtual machines is the most important function performed by this layer. A central role is played by the scheduler, which is in charge of allocating the execution of virtual machine instances. The scheduler interacts with the other components that perform a variety of tasks: The pricing and billing component takes care of the cost of executing each virtual machine instance and maintains data that will be used to charge the user.. The monitoring component tracks the execution of each virtual machine instance and maintains data required for reporting and analyzing the performance of the system..  The reservation component stores the information of all the virtual machine instances that have been executed or that will be executed in the future.. If support for QoS-based execution is provided, a QoS/sLA management component will maintain a repository of all the SLAs made with the users; together with the monitoring component, this component is used to ensure that a given virtual machine instance is executed with the desired quality of service. The VM repository component provides a catalog of virtual machine images that users can use to create virtual instances. Some implementations also allow users to upload their specific virtual machine images.  A VM pool manager component is responsible for keeping track of all the live instances Finally, if the system supports the integration of additional resources belonging to a third-party IaaS provider, a provisioning component interacts with the scheduler to provide a virtual machine instance that is external to the local physical infrastructure directly managed by the pool. The bottom layer is composed of the physical infrastructure, on top of which the management layer operates. As previously discussed, the infrastructure can be of different types; the specific infrastructure used depends on the specific use of the cloud. A service provider will most likely use a massive datacenter containing hundreds or thousands of nodes. A cloud infrastructure developed in house, in a small or medium-sized enterprise or within a university department, will most likely rely on a cluster. At the bottom of the scale it is also possible to consider a heterogeneous environ- case mostly represents an evolution of desktop grids where any available computing resource (such as PCs and workstations that are idle outside of working hours) is harnessed to provide a huge com- pute power. From an architectural point of view, the physical layer also includes the virtual resources that are rented from external IaaS providers.. In the case of complete IaaS solutions, all three levels are offered as service. This is generally the case with public clouds vendors such as Amazon, GoGrid, Joyent, Rightscale, Terremark. Rackspace, ElasticHosts, and Flexiscale, which own large datacenters and give access to their com- puting infrastructures using an IaaS approach. Other solutions instead cover only the user interface \\n\\n4.2 The cloud reference model. 117 and the infrastructure software management layers. They need to provide credentials to access third-party IaaS providers or to own a private infrastructure in which the management software is installed. This is the case with Enomaly, Elastra, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, and specific IaaS (M) solutions from VMware, IBM, and Microsoft. The proposed architecture only represents a reference model for IaaS implementations. It has. been used to provide general insight into the most common features of this approach for providing cloud computing services and the operations commonly implemented at this level. Different solu- tions can feature additional services or even not provide support for some of the features discussed here. Finally, the reference architecture applies to IaaS implementations that provide computing resources, especially for the scheduling component. If storage is the main service provided, it is still possible to distinguish these three layers. The role of infrastructure management software is not to keep track and manage the execution of virtual machines but to provide access to large infrastruc- tures and implement storage virtualization solutions on top of the physical layer.. 4.2.3 Platform as a service. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions provide a development and deployment platform for running applications in the cloud. They constitute the middleware on top of which applications are built. A general overview of the features characterizing the PaaS approach is given in Figure 4.3. Web-Based Interface Web Services, Portals, REST API.

PaaS implementations pro- vide applications with a runtime environment and do not expose any service for managing the underlying infrastructure. They automate the process of deploying applications to the infrastructure, configuring application components, provisioning and configuring supporting technologies such as load balancers and databases, and managing system change based on policies set by the user. Developers design their systems in terms of applications and are not concerned with hardware (physical or virtual), operating systems, and other low-level services. The core middleware is in charge of managing the resources and scaling applications on demand or automatically, according to the commitments made with users. From a user point of view, the core middleware exposes interfaces that allow programming and deploying applications on the cloud. These can be in the form of a Web-based interface or in the form of programming APIs and libraries. The specific development model decided for applications determines the interface exposed to the user. Some implementations provide a completely Web-based interface hosted in the cloud and offering a variety of services. It is possible to find integrated developed environments based on 4GL and visual programming concepts, or rapid prototyping environments where applications are. built by assembling mash-ups and user-defined components and successively customized. Other implementations of the PaaS model provide a complete object model for representing an applica- tion and provide a programming language-based approach. This approach generally offers more flexibility and opportunities but incurs longer development cycles. Developers generally have the full power of programming languages such as Java, .NET, Python, or Ruby, with some restrictions to provide better scalability and security. In this case the traditional development environments can be used to design and develop applications, which are then deployed on the cloud by using the APIs exposed by the PaaS provider. Specific components can be offered together with the develop- ment libraries for better exploiting the services offered by the PaaS environment. Sometimes a local runtime environment that simulates the conditions of the cloud is given to users for testing their applications before deployment. This environment can be restricted in terms of features, and it is generally not optimized for scaling.. PaaS solutions can offer middleware for developing applications together with the infrastructure or simply provide users with the software that is installed on the user premises. In the first case, the PaaS provider also owns large datacenters where applications are executed; in the second case, referred to in this book as Pure PaaS, the middleware constitutes the core value of the offering. It is also possible to have vendors that deliver both middleware and infrastructure and ship only the middleware for private installations. Table 4.2 provides a classification of the most popular PaaS implementations. It is possible to organize the various solutions into three wide categories: PaaS-I, PaaS-II, and PaaS-III. The first category identifies PaaS implementations that completely follow the cloud computing style for application development and deployment. They offer an integrated development environment hosted within the Web browser where applications are designed, developed, composed, and deployed. This is the case of Force.com and Longjump. Both deliver as platforms the combination of middleware and infrastructure. In the second class we can list all those solutions that are focused on providing a scalable infrastructure for Web application, mostly websites. In this case, developers generally use the providers\\' APIs, which are built on top of industrial runtimes, to develop \\n\\n4.2 The cloud reference model 119 Table 4.2 Platform-as-a-Service Offering Classification Vendors and Category Description Product Type Products PaaS-I Runtime environment with Web-hosted Middleware + Infrastructure Force.com application development platform.

It provides a scalable runtime based on the Java and Python programming languages, which have been modified for pro viding a secure runtime environment and enriched with additional APIs and components to support scalability. AppScale, an open-source implementation of Google AppEngine, provides interface. compatible middleware that has to be installed on a physical infrastructure. Joyent Smart Platform provides a similar approach to Google AppEngine. A different approach is taken by Heroku and Engine Yard, which provide scalability support for Ruby- and Ruby on Rails-based Websites. In this case developers design and create their applications with the traditional methods and then deploy them by uploading to the provider\\'s platform. The third category consists of all those solutions that provide a cloud programming platform for any kind of application, not only Web applications. Among these, the most popular is Microsoft Windows Azure, which provides a comprehensive framework for building service oriented cloud applications on top of the .NET technology, hosted on Microsoft\\'s datacenters. Other solutions in the same category, such as Manjrasoft Aneka, Apprenda SaaSGrid, Appistry Cloud IQ Platform, DataSynapse, and GigaSpaces DataGrid, provide only middleware with differ ent services. Table 4.2 shows only a few options available in the Platform-as-a-Service market segment. The PaaS umbrella encompasses a variety of solutions for developing and hosting applications in the cloud. Despite this heterogeneity, it is possible to identify some criteria that are expected to \\n\\n120 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture be found in any implementation. As noted by Sam Charrington, product manager at Appistry.com, there are some essential characteristics that identify a PaaS solution:. Runtime framework. This framework represents the \"software stack\" of the PaaS model and the most intuitive aspect that comes to people\\'s minds when they refer to PaaS solutions. The runtime framework executes end-user code according to the policies set by the user and the provider. Abstraction. PaaS solutions are distinguished by the higher level of abstraction that they provide. Whereas in the case of IaaS solutions the focus is on delivering \"raw\\' access to virtual or physical infrastructure, in the case of PaaS the focus is on the applications the cloud must support. This means that PaaS solutions offer a way to deploy and manage applications on the cloud rather than a bunch of virtual machines on top of which the IT infrastructure is built and configured. Automation. PaaS environments automate the process of deploying applications to the infrastructure, scaling them by provisioning additional resources when needed. This process is performed automatically and according to the SLA made between the customers and the provider. This feature is normally not native in IaaS solutions, which only provide ways to provision more resources. Cloud services. PaaS offerings provide developers and architects with services and APIs. helping them to simplify the creation and delivery of elastic and highly available cloud applications. These services are the key differentiators among competing PaaS solutions and generally include specific components for developing applications, advanced services for application monitoring, management, and reporting. Another essential component for a PaaS-based approach is the ability to integrate third-party cloud services offered from other vendors by leveraging service-oriented architecture. Such inte- gration should happen through standard interfaces and protocols. This opportunity makes the development of applications more agile and able to evolve according to the needs of customers and users. Many of the PaaS offerings provide this facility, which is naturally built into the frame- work they leverage to provide a cloud computing solution.. One of the major concerns of leveraging PaaS solutions for implementing applications is vendor lock-in. Differently from IaaS solutions, which deliver bare virtual servers that can be fully custom- ized in terms of the software stack installed, PaaS environments deliver a platform for developing applications, which exposes a well-defined set of APIs and, in most cases, binds the application to the specific runtime of the PaaS provider. Even though a platform-based approach strongly simpli- fies the development and deployment cycle of applications, it poses the risk of making these appli- cations completely dependent on the provider. Such dependency can become a significant obstacle in retargeting the application to another environment and runtime if the commitments made with the provider cease. The impact of the vendor lock-in on applications obviously varies according to the various solutions. Some of them, such as Force.com, rely on a proprietary runtime framework which makes the retargeting process very difficult. Others, such as Google AppEngine and Microsoft Azure, rely on industry-standard runtimes but utilize private data storage facilities and 2The full detail of this analysis can be found in the Cloud-pulse blog post available at the following address: http:// Cloudpulseblog.com/2010/02/the-essential-characteristics-of-paas. \\n\\n4.2 The cloud reference model 121 computing infrastructure. In this case it is possible to find alternatives based on PaaS solutions implementing the same interfaces, with perhaps different performance. Others, such as Appistry Cloud IQ Platform, Heroku, and Engine Yard, completely rely on open standards, thus making the migration of applications easier. Finally, from a financial standpoint, although IaaS solutions allow shifting the capital cost into operational costs through outsourcing, PaaS solutions can cut the cost across development, deploy. ment, and management of applications. It helps management reduce the risk of ever-changing tech- nologies by offloading the cost of upgrading the technology to the PaaS provider. This happens transparently for the consumers of this model, who can concentrate their effort on the core value of their business. The PaaS approach, when bundled with underlying IaaS solutions, helps even small start-up companies quickly offer customers integrated solutions on a hosted platform at a very mini- mal cost. These opportunities make the PaaS offering a viable option that targets different market segments. 4.2.4 Software as a service Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a software delivery model that provides access to applications through the Internet as a Web-based service. It provides a means to free users from complex hard- ware and software management by offloading such tasks to third parties, which build applications accessible to multiple users through a Web browser. In this scenario, customers neither need install anything on their premises nor have to pay considerable up-front costs to purchase the software and the required licenses. They simply access the application website, enter their credentials and billing details, and can instantly use the application, which, in most of the cases, can be further customized for their needs. On the provider side, the specific details and features of each customer\\'s applica tion are maintained in the infrastructure and made available on demand. The SaaS model is appealing for applications serving a wide range of users and that can be adapted to specific needs with little further customization. This requirement characterizes SaaS as a \"one-to-many\" software delivery model, whereby an application is shared across multiple users This is the case of CRM\\' and ERP\\' applications that constitute common needs for almost all enter- prises, from small to medium-sized and large business. Every enterprise will have the same requirements for the basic features concerning CRM and ERP; different needs can be satisfied with further customization. This scenario facilitates the development of software platforms that provide a general set of features and support specialization and ease of integration of new components Moreover, it constitutes the perfect candidate for hosted solutions, since the applications delivered to the user are the same, and the applications themselves provide users with the means to shape the 3CRM is an acronym for customer relationship management and identifies concerns related to interactions with custo- mers and prospect sales. CRM solutions are software systems that simplify the process of managing customers and iden- tifying sales strategies. 4ERP, an acronym for enterprise resource planning, generally refers to an integrated computer-based system used to manage internal and external resources, including tangible assets, materials, and financial and human resources. ERP software provides an integrated view of the enterprise and facilitates the management of the information flows between business functions and resources. \\n\\n122 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture applications according to user needs. As a result, SaaS applications are naturally multitenant. Multitenancy, which is a feature of SaaS compared to traditional packaged software, allows provi- ders to centralize and sustain the effort of managing large hardware infrastructures, maintaining and upgrading applications transparently to the users, and optimizing resources by sharing the costs among the large user base. On the customer side, such costs constitute a minimal fraction of the usage fee paid for the software.. As noted previously (see Section 1.2), the concept of software as a service preceded cloud com- puting, starting to circulate at the end of the 1990s, when it began to gain marketplace acceptance [31]. The acronym SaaS was then coined in 2001 by the Software Information & Industry Association (SIIA) [32] with the following connotation: In the software as a service model, the application, or service, is deployed from a centralized datacenter across a network-Internet, Intranet, LAN, or VPN-providing access and use on a the applications from a central provider. Business models vary according to the level to which the software is streamlined, to lower price and increase efficiency, or value-added through cus-. tomization to further improve digitized business processes. The analysis carried out by SIA was mainly oriented to cover application service providers (ASPs) and all their variations, which capture the concept of software applications consumed as a service in a broader sense. ASPs already had some of the core characteristics of SaaS: . The product sold to customer is application access.  The application is centrally managed. The service delivered is one-to-many.  The service delivered is an integrated solution delivered on the contract, which means provided as promised. Initially ASPs offered hosting solutions for packaged applications, which were served to multi- ple customers. Successively, other options, such as Web-based integration of third-party application services, started to gain interest and a new range of opportunities open up to independent software vendors and service providers. These opportunities eventually evolved into a more flexible model to deliver applications as a service: the SaaS model. ASPs provided access to packaged software solutions that addressed the needs of a variety of customers. Initially this approach was affordable for service providers, but it later became inconvenient when the cost of customizations and speciali- zations increased. The SaaS approach introduces a more flexible way of delivering application ser vices that are fully customizable by the user by integrating new services, injecting their own components, and designing the application and information workflows. Such a new approach has also been possible with the support of Web 2.0 technologies, which allowed turning the Web browser into a full-featured interface, able even to support application composition and development. How is cloud computing related to Saas? According to the classification of services shown in Figure 4.1, the SaaS approach lays on top of the cloud computing stack. It fits into the cloud com- puting vision expressed by the XaaS acronym, Everything-as-a-Service; and with SaaS, applications \\n\\n4.2 The cloud reference model 123 are delivered as a service. Initially the SaaS model was of interest only for lead users and early adopters. The benefits delivered at that stage were the following:. Software cost reduction and total cost of ownership (TCO) were paramount  Service-level improvements  Rapid implementation Standalone and configurable applications.  Rudimentary application and data integration.  Subscription and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pricing With the advent of cloud computing there has been an increasing acceptance of SaaS as a viable software delivery model. This led to transition into SaaS 2.0 [40], which does not introduce a new technology but transforms the way in which SaaS is used.. In particular, SaaS 2.0 is focused on providing a more robust infrastructure and application plat forms driven by SLAs. Rather than being characterized as a more rapid implementation and deploy ment environment, SaaS 2.0 will focus on the rapid achievement of business objectives. This is why such evolution does not introduce any new technology: The existing technologies are com- posed together in order to achieve business goals efficiently. Fundamental to this perspective is the ability to leverage existing solutions and integrate value-added business services. The existing SaaS infrastructures not only allow the development and customization of applications, but they also facilitate the integration of services that are exposed by other parties. SaaS applications are then the result of the interconnection and the synergy of different applications and components that together provide customers with added value. This approach dramatically changes the software ecosystem of the SaaS market, which is no longer monopolized by a few vendors but is now a fully intercon- nected network of service providers, clustered around some \"big hubs\"\\' that deliver the application to the customer. In this scenario, each single component integrated into the SaaS application becomes responsible to the user for ensuring the attached SLA and at the same time could be priced differently. Customers can then choose how to specialize their applications by deciding which com ponents and services they want to integrate. Software-as-a-Service applications can serve different needs. CRM, ERP, and social networking applications are definitely the most popular ones. SalesForce.com is probably the most successful and popular example of a CRM service. It provides a wide range of services for applications: customer relationship and human resource management, enterprise resource planning, and many other features. SalesForce.com builds on top of the Force.com platform, which provides a fully featured environment for building applications. It offers either a programming language or a visual environment to arrange components together for building applications. In addition to the basic features provided, the integra- tion with third-party-made applications enriches SalesForce.com\\'s value. In particular, through AppExchange customers can publish, search, and integrate new services and features into their exist- ing applications. This makes SalesForce.com applications completely extensible and customizable Similar solutions are offered by NetSuite and RightNow. NetSuite is an integrated software business suite featuring financials, CRM, inventory, and ecommerce functionalities integrated all together. RightNow is customer experience-centered SaaS application that integrates together different features, from chat to Web communities, to support the common activity of an enterprise. \\n\\n124 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture Another important class of popular SaaS applications comprises social networking applications such as Facebook and professional networking sites such as LinkedIn. Other than providing the basic features of networking, they allow incorporating and extending their capabilities by integrat- ing third-party applications. These can be developed as plug-ins for the hosting platform, as hap- pens for Facebook, and made available to users, who can select which applications they want to add to their profile. As a result, the integrated applications get full access to the network of contacts and users\\' profile data. The nature of these applications can be of different types: office automation components, games, or integration with other existing services.. Office automation applications are also an important representative for SaaS applications: Google Documents and Zoho Office are examples of Web-based applications that aim to address all user needs for documents, spreadsheets, and presentation management. They offer a Web-based interface for creating, managing, and modifying documents that can be easily shared among users and made accessible from anywhere. It is important to note the role of SaaS solution enablers, which provide an environment in which to integrate third-party services and share information with others. A quite successful exam- ple is Box.net, an SaaS application providing users with a Web space and profile that can be enriched and extended with third-party applications such as office automation, integration with CRM-based solutions, social Websites, and photo editing.. 4.3 Types of clouds Clouds constitute the primary outcome of cloud computing. They are a type of parallel and distrib uted system harnessing physical and virtual computers presented as a unified computing resource. Clouds build the infrastructure on top of which services are implemented and delivered to custo- mers. Such infrastructures can be of different types and provide useful information about the nature and the services offered by the cloud. A more useful classification is given according to the admin- istrative domain of a cloud: It identifies the boundaries within which cloud computing services are implemented, provides hints on the underlying infrastructure adopted to support such services, and qualifies them. It is then possible to differentiate four different types of cloud: Public clouds. The cloud is open to the wider public.. Private clouds. The cloud is implemented within the private premises of an institution and generally made accessible to the members of the institution or a subset of them.. Hybrid or heterogeneous clouds. The cloud is a combination of the two previous solutions and most likely identifies a private cloud that has been augmented with resources or services hosted in a public cloud. Community clouds. The cloud is characterized by a multi-administrative domain involving different deployment models (public, private, and hybrid), and it is specifically designed to address the needs of a specific industry. Almost all the implementations of clouds can be classified in this categorization. In the follow- ing sections, we provide brief characterizations of these clouds.. \\n\\n4.3 Types of clouds 125 4.3.1 Public clouds Public clouds constitute the first expression of cloud computing. They are a realization of the canonical view of cloud computing in which the services offered are made available to anyone. from anywhere, and at any time through the Internet. From a structural point of view they are a dis- tributed system, most likely composed of one or more datacenters connected together, on top of which the specific services offered by the cloud are implemented. Any customer can easily sign in with the cloud provider, enter her credential and billing details, and use the services offered. Historically, public clouds were the first class of cloud that were implemented and offered They offer solutions for minimizing IT infrastructure costs and serve as a viable option for handling peak loads on the local infrastructure. They have become an interesting option for small enterprises, which are able to start their businesses without large up-front investments by completely relying on public infrastructure for their IT needs. What made attractive public clouds compared to the reshap. ing of the private premises and the purchase of hardware and software was the ability to grow or shrink according to the needs of the related business. By renting the infrastructure or subscribing to application services, customers were able to dynamically upsize or downsize their IT according to the demands of their business. Currently, public clouds are used both to completely replace the IT infrastructure of enterprises and to extend it when it is required.. A fundamental characteristic of public clouds is multitenancy. A public cloud is meant to serve a multitude of users, not a single customer. Any customer requires a virtual computing environment that is separated, and most likely isolated, from other users. This is a fundamental requirement to provide effective monitoring of user activities and guarantee the desired performance and the other QoS attributes negotiated with users. QoS management is a very important aspect of public clouds. Hence, a significant portion of the software infrastructure is devoted to monitoring the cloud resources, to bill them according to the contract made with the user, and to keep a complete history of cloud usage for each customer. These features are fundamental to public clouds because they help providers offer services to users with full accountability.. A public cloud can offer any kind of service: infrastructure, platform, or applications. For example, Amazon EC2 is a public cloud that provides infrastructure as a service; Google AppEngine is a public cloud that provides an application development platform as a service; and SalesForce.com is a public cloud that provides software as a service. What makes public clouds peculiar is the way they are con- sumed: They are available to everyone and are generally architected to support a large quantity of users. What characterizes them is their natural ability to scale on demand and sustain peak loads. From an architectural point of view there is no restriction concerning the type of distributed sys- tem implemented to support public clouds. Most likely, one or more datacenters constitute the physical infrastructure on top of which the services are implemented and delivered. Public clouds can be composed of geographically dispersed datacenters to share the load of users and better serve them according to their locations. For example, Amazon Web Services has datacenters installed in the United States, Europe, Singapore, and Australia; they allow their customers to choose between three different regions: us-west-1, us-east-1, or eu-west-1. Such regions are priced differently and are further divided into availability zones, which map to specific datacenters. According to the spe cific class of services delivered by the cloud, a different software stack is installed to manage the infrastructure: virtual machine managers, distributed middleware, or distributed applications. \\n\\n126 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture 4.3.2 Private clouds Public clouds are appealing and provide a viable option to cut IT costs and reduce capital expenses. but they are not applicable in all scenarios. For example, a very common critique to the use of cloud computing in its canonical implementation is the loss of control. In the case of public clouds, the provider is in control of the infrastructure and, eventually, of the customers\\' core logic and sen sitive data. Even though there could be regulatory procedure in place that guarantees fair manage- ment and respect of the customer\\'s privacy, this condition can still be perceived as a threat or as an unacceptable risk that some organizations are not willing to take. In particular, institutions such as government and military agencies will not consider public clouds as an option for processing or storing their sensitive data. The risk of a breach in the security infrastructure of the provider could expose such information to others; this could simply be considered unacceptable. In other cases, the loss of control of where your virtual IT infrastructure resides could open the way to other problematic situations. More precisely, the geographical location of a datacenter gen- erally determines the regulations that are applied to management of digital information. As a result, according to the specific location of data, some sensitive information can be made accessible to government agencies or even considered outside the law if processed with specific cryptographic techniques. For example, the USA PATRIOT Act provides its government and other agencies with virtually limitless powers to access information, including that belonging to any company that stores information in the U.S. territory. Finally, existing enterprises that have large computing infra- structures or large installed bases of software do not simply want to switch to public clouds, but they use the existing IT resources and optimize their revenue. All these aspects make the use of a public computing infrastructure not always possible. Yet the general idea supported by the cloud computing vision can still be attractive. More specifically, having an infrastructure able to deliver IT services on demand can still be a winning solution, even when implemented within the private premises of an institution. This idea led to the diffusion of private clouds, which are similar to pub- lic clouds, but their resource-provisioning model is limited within the boundaries of an Organization. Private clouds are virtual distributed systems that rely on a private infrastructure and provide internal users with dynamic provisioning of computing resources. Instead of a pay-as-you-go model as in public clouds, there could be other schemes in place, taking into account the usage of the cloud and proportionally billing the different departments or sections of an enterprise. Private clouds have the advantage of keeping the core business operations in-house by relying on the exist- ing IT infrastructure and reducing the burden of maintaining it once the cloud has been set up. In this scenario, security concerns are less critical, since sensitive information does not flow out of the private infrastructure. Moreover, existing IT resources can be better utilized because the private cloud can provide services to a different range of users. Another interesting opportunity that comes with private clouds is the possibility of testing applications and systems at a comparatively lower 5The USA PATRIOT Act is a statute enacted by the U.S. government that increases the ability of law enforcement agen- cies to search telephone, email, medical, financial, and other records and eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gather- ing within the United States. The full text of the act is available at the Website of the Library of the Congress at the following address: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:hr03162: (accessed April 20, 2010) \\n\\n4.3 Types of clouds 127 price rather than public clouds before deploying them on the public virtual infrastructure. A Forrester report [34] on the benefits of delivering in-house cloud computing solutions for enter- prises highlighted some of the key advantages of using a private cloud computing infrastructure: Customer information protection. Despite assurances by the public cloud leaders about security, few provide satisfactory disclosure or have long enough histories with their cloud offerings to provide warranties about the specific level of security put in place on their systems. In-house security is easier to maintain and rely on.. Infrastructure ensuring SLAs. Quality of service implies specific operations such as appropriate clustering and failover, data replication, system monitoring and maintenance, and disaster recovery, and other uptime services can be commensurate to the application needs. Although public cloud vendors provide some of these features, not all of them are available as needed. Compliance with standard procedures and operations. If organizations are subject to third-party compliance standards, specific procedures have to be put in place when deploying and executing applications. This could be not possible in the case of the virtual public infrastructure. All these aspects make the use of cloud-based infrastructures in private premises an interesting Option. From an architectural point of view, private clouds can be implemented on more heterogeneous hardware: They generally rely on the existing IT infrastructure already deployed on the private pre. mises. This could be a datacenter, a cluster, an enterprise desktop grid, or a combination of them The physical layer is complemented with infrastructure management software (i.e., IaaS (M); see Section 4.2.2) or a PaaS solution, according to the service delivered to the users of the cloud. Different options can be adopted to implement private clouds. Figure 4.4 provides a compre- hensive view of the solutions together with some reference to the most popular software used to deploy private clouds. At the bottom layer of the software stack, virtual machine technologies such as Xen [35], KVM [36], and VMware serve as the foundations of the cloud. Virtual machine management technologies such as VMware vCloud, Eucalyptus [37], and OpenNebula [38] can be used to control the virtual infrastructure and provide an IaaS solution. VMware vCloud is a proprietary solution, but Eucalyptus provides full compatibility with Amazon Web Services interfaces and supports different virtual machine technologies such as Xen, KVM, and VMware. Like Eucalyptus, OpenNebula is an open-source solution for virtual infrastructure man- agement that supports KVM, Xen, and VMware, which has been designed to easily integrate third-party IaaS providers. Its modular architecture allows extending the software with additional features such as the capability of reserving virtual machine instances by using Haizea [39] as scheduler. Solutions that rely on the previous virtual machine managers and provide added value are OpenPEX [40] and InterGrid [41]. OpenPEX is Web-based system that allows the reservation of virtual machine instances and is designed to support different back ends (at the moment only the support for Xen is implemented). InterGrid provides added value on top of OpenNebula and Amazon EC2 by allowing the reservation of virtual machine instances and managing multi- administrative domain clouds. PaaS solutions can provide an additional layer and deliver a high level service for private clouds. Among the options available for private deployment of clouds we can consider DataSynapse, Zimory Pools, Elastra, and Aneka. DataSynapse is a global provider of application virtualization software. By relying on the VMware virtualization technology, \\n\\n128 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture Platform-as-a-Service Solutions DataSynapse, Zimory Pools, PaaS Elastra CloudServer, Aneka, ..... laaS Infrastructure Management Software Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, VMWare vCloud, OpenPEX, InterGrid, ....

DataSynapse provides a flexible environment for building private clouds on top of datacenters. Elastra Cloud Server is a platform for easily configuring and deploying distributed application infrastructures on clouds. Zimory provides a software infrastructure layer that automates the use of resource pools based on Xen, KVM, and VMware virtualization technologies. It allows creating an internal cloud composed of sparse private and public resources and provides facilities for migrating. applications within the existing infrastructure. Aneka is a software development platform that can be used to deploy a cloud infrastructure on top of heterogeneous hardware: datacenters, clusters, and desktop grids. It provides a pluggable service-oriented architecture that\\'s mainly devoted to supporting the execution of distributed applications with different programming models: bag of tasks, MapReduce, and others. Private clouds can provide in-house solutions for cloud computing, but if compared to public clouds they exhibit more limited capability to scale elastically on demand.. 4.3.3 Hybrid clouds Public clouds are large software and hardware infrastructures that have a capability that is huge enough to serve the needs of multiple users, but they suffer from security threats and administra- tive pitfalls. Although the option of completely relying on a public virtual infrastructure is appeal- ing for companies that did not incur IT capital costs and have just started considering their IT needs (i.e., start-ups), in most cases the private cloud option prevails because of the existing IT infrastructure. \\n\\n4.3 Types of clouds 129 Private clouds are the perfect solution when it is necessary to keep the processing of informa tion within an enterprise\\'s premises or it is necessary to use the existing hardware and software infrastructure. One of the major drawbacks of private deployments is the inability to scale on demand and to efficiently address peak loads. In this case, it is important to leverage capabilities of public clouds as needed. Hence, a hybrid solution could be an interesting opportunity for taking advantage of the best of the private and public worlds. This led to the development and diffusion of hybrid clouds. Hybrid clouds allow enterprises to exploit existing IT infrastructures, maintain sensitive infor mation within the premises, and naturally grow and shrink by provisioning external resources and releasing them when they\\'re no longer needed. Security concerns are then only limited to the public portion of the cloud that can be used to perform operations with less stringent constraints but that are still part of the system workload. Figure 4.5 provides a general overview of a hybrid cloud: It is a heterogeneous distributed system resulting from a private cloud that integrates additional services or resources from one or more public clouds. For this reason they are also called heterogeneous clouds. As depicted in the diagram, dynamic provisioning is a fundamental component in this sce- nario. Hybrid clouds address scalability issues by leveraging external resources for exceeding Hybrid / Heterogeneous Cloud Public Cloud Private Cloud Paas Dynamic  Provisioning laaS(M) Public Cloud Datacenter Cluster Desktop Grids NOWs FIGURE 4.5 Hybrid/heterogeneous cloud overview. \\n\\n130 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture capacity demand. These resources or services are temporarily leased for the time required and then released. This practice is also known as cloudbursting. Whereas the concept of hybrid cloud is general, it mostly applies to IT infrastructure rather than software services. Service-oriented computing already introduces the concept of integration of paid software services with existing application deployed in the private premises. In an IaaS scenario, dynamic provisioning refers to the ability to acquire on demand virtual machines in order to increase the capability of the resulting distributed system and then release them. Infrastructure man- agement software and PaaS solutions are the building blocks for deploying and managing hybrid clouds. In particular, with respect to private clouds, dynamic provisioning introduces a more com- plex scheduling algorithm and policies, the goal of which is also to optimize the budget spent to rent public resources. Infrastructure management software such as OpenNebula already exposes the capability of inte- grating resources from public clouds such as Amazon EC2. In this case the virtual machine obtained from the public infrastructure is managed as all the other virtual machine instances main- tained locally. What is missing is then an advanced scheduling engine that\\'s able to differentiate these resources and provide smart allocations by taking into account the budget available to extend the existing infrastructure. In the case of OpenNebula, advanced schedulers such as Haizea can be integrated to provide cost-based scheduling. A different approach is taken by InterGrid. This is essentially a distributed scheduling engine that manages the allocation of virtual machines in a col- lection of peer networks. Such networks can be represented by a local cluster, a gateway to a public cloud, or a combination of the two. Once a request is submitted to one of the InterGrid gateways, it is served by possibly allocating virtual instances in all the peered networks, and the allocation of requests is performed by taking into account the user budget and the peering arrangements between networks. Dynamic provisioning is most commonly implemented in PaaS solutions that support hybrid clouds. As previously discussed, one of the fundamental components of PaaS middleware is the mapping of distributed applications onto the cloud infrastructure. In this scenario, the role of dynamic provisioning becomes fundamental to ensuring the execution of applications under the QoS agreed on with the user. For example, Aneka provides a provisioning service that leverages different IaaS providers for scaling the existing cloud infrastructure [42]. The provisioning service cooperates with the scheduler, which is in charge of guaranteeing a specific QoS for applications. In particular, each user application has a budget attached, and the scheduler uses that budget to optimize the execution of the application by renting virtual nodes if needed. Other PaaS implemen- tations support the deployment of hybrid clouds and provide dynamic provisioning capabilities Among those discussed for the implementation and management of private clouds we can cite Elastra CloudServer and Zimory Pools. 6According to the Cloud Computing Wiki, the term cloudburst has a double meaning; it also refers to the \"failure of a cloud computing environment due to the inability to handle a spike in demand\" (http://sites.google.com/site/ Cloudcomputingwiki/Home/Cloud-computing-vocabulary). In this book, we always refer to the dynamic provisioning of resources from public clouds when mentioning this term. \\n\\n4.3 Types of clouds 131 Community Cloud Infrastructure Application Services Third-Party Cloud Public Cloud Development Private Cloud  Platforms Public Cloud Private Cloud Federal and Government Bodies Private Users Industries Enterprises Public Services FIGURE 4.6 A community cloud. 4.3.4 Community clouds Community clouds are distributed systems created by integrating the services of different clouds to address the specific needs of an industry, a community, or a business sector. The National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) [43] characterizes community clouds as follows: The infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise.. Figure 4.6 provides a general view of the usage scenario of community clouds, together with reference architecture. The users of a specific community cloud fall into a well-identified commu- nity, sharing the same concerns or needs; they can be government bodies, industries, or even simple users, but all of them focus on the same issues for their interaction with the cloud. This is a differ- ent scenario than public clouds, which serve a multitude of users with different needs. Community clouds are also different from private clouds, where the services are generally delivered within the institution that owns the cloud.. From an architectural point of view, a community cloud is most likely implemented over multi ple administrative domains. This means that different organizations such as government bodies, \\n\\n132 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture private enterprises, research organizations, and even public virtual infrastructure providers contrib- ute with their resources to build the cloud infrastructure.. Candidate sectors for community clouds are as follows:  Media industry. In the media industry, companies are looking for low-cost, agile, and simple solutions to improve the efficiency of content production. Most media productions involve an extended ecosystem of partners. In particular, the creation of digital content is the outcome of a collaborative process that includes movement of large data, massive compute-intensive rendering tasks, and complex workflow executions. Community clouds can provide a shared environment where services can facilitate business-to-business collaboration and offer the media production. Healthcare industry. In the healthcare industry, there are different scenarios in which community clouds could be of use. In particular, community clouds can provide a global platform on which to share information and knowledge without revealing sensitive data maintained within the private infrastructure. The naturally hybrid deployment model of community clouds can easily support the storing of patient-related data in a private cloud while using the shared infrastructure for noncritical services and automating processes within hospitals. Energy and other core industries. In these sectors, community clouds can bundle the comprehensive set of solutions that together vertically address management, deployment, and orchestration of services and operations. Since these industries involve different providers, create an open and fair market. Public sector. Legal and political restrictions in the public sector can limit the adoption of public cloud offerings. Moreover, governmental processes involve several institutions and agencies and are aimed at providing strategic solutions at local, national, and international administrative levels. They involve business-to-administration, citizen-to-administration, and possibly business-to-business processes. Some examples include invoice approval, infrastructure planning, and public hearings. A community cloud can constitute the optimal venue to provide a distributed environment in which to create a communication platform for performing such operations. Scientific research. Science clouds are an interesting example of community clouds. In this case, the common interest driving different organizations sharing a large distributed infrastructure is scientific computing. The term community cloud can also identify a more specific type of cloud that arises from con- cern over the controls of vendors in cloud computing and that aspire to combine the principles of digital ecosystems\\' [44] with the case study of cloud computing. A community cloud is formed by harnessing the underutilized resources of user machines [45] and providing an infrastructure in \\'Digital ecosystems are distributed, adaptive, and open sociotechnical systems with properties of self-organization, scal- ability, and sustainability inspired by natural ecosystems. The primary aim of digital ecosystems is to sustain the regional development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \\n\\n4.4 Economics of the cloud. 133 which each can be at the same time a consumer, a producer, or a coordinator of the services offered by the cloud. The benefits of these community clouds are the following: Openness. By removing the dependency on cloud vendors, community clouds are open systems in which fair competition between different solutions can happen.. Community. Being based on a collective that provides resources and services, the infrastructure turns out to be more scalable because the system can grow simply by expanding its user base. Graceful failures. Since there is no single provider or vendor in control of the infrastructure, there is no single point of failure... Convenience and control. Within a community cloud there is no conflict between convenience and control because the cloud is shared and owned by the community, which makes all the decisions through a collective democratic process.. Environmental sustainability. The community cloud is supposed to have a smaller carbon footprint because it harnesses underutilized resources. Moreover, these clouds tend to be more organic by growing and shrinking in a symbiotic relationship to support the demand of the community, which in turn sustains it. This is an alternative vision of a community cloud, focusing more on the social aspect of the clouds that are formed as an aggregation of resources of community members. The idea of a hetero geneous infrastructure built to serve the needs of a community of people is also reflected in the pre- vious definition, but in that case the attention is focused on the commonality of interests that aggregates the users of the cloud into a community. In both cases, the concept of community is fundamental. 4.4 Economics of the cloud. The main drivers of cloud computing are economy of scale and simplicity of software delivery and its operation. In fact, the biggest benefit of this phenomenon is financial: the pay-as-you-go model offered by cloud providers. In particular, cloud computing allows:.  Reducing the capital costs associated to the IT infrastructure. Eliminating the depreciation or lifetime costs associated with IT capital assets  Replacing software licensing with subscriptions. Cutting the maintenance and administrative costs of IT resources A capital cost is the cost occurred in purchasing an asset that is useful in the production of goods or the rendering of services. Capital costs are one-time expenses that are generally paid up front and that will contribute over the long term to generate profit. The IT infrastructure and the software are capital assets because enterprises require them to conduct their business. At present it does not matter whether the principal business of an enterprise is related to IT, because the business will definitely have an IT department that is used to automate many of the activities that are per- formed within the enterprise: payroll, customer relationship management, enterprise resource plan- ning, tracking and inventory of products, and others. Hence, IT resources constitute a capital cost \\n\\n134 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture expenses that will generate profit over time; more than that, since they are associated with material things they are subject to depreciation over time, which in the end reduces the profit of the enterprise because such costs are directly subtracted from the enterprise revenues. In the case of IT capital costs, the depreciation costs are represented by the loss of value of the hardware over time and the aging of software products that need to be replaced because new features are required. Before cloud computing diffused within the enterprise, the budget spent on IT infrastructure and software constituted a significant expense for medium-sized and large enterprises. Many enterprises own a small or medium-sized datacenter that introduces several operational costs in terms of main- tenance, electricity, and cooling. Additional operational costs are occurred in maintaining an IT department and an IT support center. Moreover, other costs are triggered by the purchase of potentially expensive software. With cloud computing these costs are significantly reduced or sim- ply disappear according to its penetration. One of the advantages introduced by the cloud comput- ing model is that it shifts the capital costs previously allocated to the purchase of hardware and software into operational costs inducted by renting the infrastructure and paying subscriptions for the use of software. These costs can be better controlled according to the business needs and pros- perity of the enterprise. Cloud computing also introduces reductions in administrative and mainte- nance costs. That is, there is no or limited need for having administrative staff take care of the management of the cloud infrastructure. At the same time, the cost of IT support staff is also reduced. When it comes to depreciation costs, they simply disappear for the enterprise, since in a scenario where all the IT needs are served by the cloud there are no IT capital assets that depreciate over time. The amount of cost savings that cloud computing can introduce within an enterprise is related to the specific scenario in which cloud services are used and how they contribute to generate a profit for the enterprise. In the case of a small startup, it is possible to completely leverage the cloud for many aspects, such as: .IT infrastructure :Software development CRM and ERP In this case it is possible to completely eliminate capital costs because there are no initial IT assets. The situation is completely different in the case of enterprises that already have a consider- able amount of IT assets. In this case, cloud computing, especially IaaS-based solutions, can help manage unplanned capital costs that are generated by the needs of the enterprise in the short term. In this case, by leveraging cloud computing, these costs can be turned into operational costs that last as long as there is a need for them. For example, IT infrastructure leasing helps more effi- ciently manage peak loads without inducing capital expenses. As soon as the increased load does not justify the use of additional resources, these can be released and the costs associated with them disappear. This is the most adopted model of cloud computing because many enterprises already have IT facilities. Another option is to make a slow transition toward cloud-based solutions while the capital IT assets get depreciated and need to be replaced. Between these two cases there is a wide variety of scenarios in which cloud computing could be of help in generating profits for enterprises. \\n\\n4.5 Open challenges 135 Another important aspect is the elimination of some indirect costs that are generated by IT assets, such as software licensing and support and carbon footprint emissions. With cloud comput- ing, an enterprise uses software applications on a subscription basis, and there is no need for any licensing fee because the software providing the service remains the property of the provider. Leveraging IaaS solutions allows room for datacenter consolidation that in the end could result in a smaller carbon footprint. In some countries such as Australia, the carbon footprint emissions are taxable, so by reducing or completely eliminating such emissions, enterprises can pay less tax. In terms of the pricing models introduced by cloud computing, we can distinguish three differ- ent strategies that are adopted by the providers: Tiered pricing. In this model, cloud services are offered in several tiers, each of which offers a fixed computing specification and SLA at a specific price per unit of time. This model is used by Amazon for pricing the EC2 service, which makes available different server configurations in terms of computing capacity (CPU type and speed, memory) that have different costs per hour. Per-unit pricing. This model is more suitable to cases where the principal source of revenue for the cloud provider is determined in terms of units of specific services, such as data transfer and memory allocation. In this scenario customers can configure their systems more efficiently according to the application needs. This model is used, for example, by GoGrid, which makes customers pay according to RAM/hour units for the servers deployed in the GoGrid cloud. Subscription-based pricing. This is the model used mostly by SaaS providers in which users pay a periodic subscription fee for use of the software or the specific component services that are integrated in their applications. All of these costs are based on a pay-as-you-go model, which constitutes a more flexible solu- tion for supporting the delivery on demand of IT services. This is what actually makes possible the conversion of IT capital costs into operational costs, since the cost of buying hardware turns into a cost for leasing it and the cost generated by the purchase of software turns into a subscription fee paid for using it. 4.5 Open challenges Still in its infancy, cloud computing presents many challenges for industry and academia. There is a significant amount of work in academia focused on defining the challenges brought by this phe- nomenon [46-49]. In this section, we highlight the most important ones: the definition and the for- malization of cloud computing, the interoperation between different clouds, the creation of standards, security, scalability, fault tolerance, and organizational aspects. 4.5.1 Cloud definition As discussed earlier, there have been several attempts made to define cloud computing and to pro vide a classification of all the services and technologies identified as such. One of the most com- prehensive formalizations is noted in the NIST working definition of cloud computing [43]. It characterizes cloud computing as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource-pooling. \\n\\n136 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture rapid elasticity, and measured service; classifies services as SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS; and categorizes deployment models as public, private, community, and hybrid clouds. The view is in line with our discussion and shared by many IT practitioners and academics. Despite the general agreement on the NIST definition, there are alternative taxonomies for cloud services. David Linthicum, founder of BlueMountains Labs, provides a more detailed classifica- tion, which comprehends 10 different classes and better suits the vision of cloud computing within the enterprise. A different approach has been taken at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCsB) [50], which departs from the XaaS concept and tries to define an ontology for cloud com- puting. In their work the concept of a cloud is dissected into five main layers: applications, soft- ware environments, software infrastructure, software kernel, and hardware. Each layer addresses the needs of a different class of users within the cloud computing community and most likely builds on the underlying layers. According to the authors, this work constitutes the first effort to provide a more robust interaction model between the different cloud entities on both the functional level and the semantic level.. These characterizations and taxonomies reflect what is meant by cloud computing at the present time, but being in its infancy the phenomenon is constantly evolving, and the same will happen to the attempts to capture the real nature of cloud computing. It is interesting to note that the principal characterization used in this book as a reference for introducing and explaining cloud computing is considered a working definition, which by nature identifies something that continuously changes over time by becoming refined.. 4.5.2 Cloud interoperability and standards Cloud computing is a service-based model for delivering IT infrastructure and applications like util- ities such as power, water, and electricity. To fully realize this goal, introducing standards and allowing interoperability between solutions offered by different vendors are objectives of funda- mental importance. Vendor lock-in constitutes one of the major strategic barriers against the seam- less adoption of cloud computing at all stages. In particular there is major fear on the part of enterprises in which IT constitutes the significant part of their revenues. Vendor lock-in can prevent a customer from switching to another competitor\\'s solution, or when this is possible, it happens at considerable conversion cost and requires significant amounts of time. This can occur either because the customer wants to find a more suitable solution for customer needs or because the ven- dor is no longer able to provide the required service. The presence of standards that are actually implemented and adopted in the cloud computing community could give room for interoperability and then lessen the risks resulting from vendor lock-in. The current state of standards and interoperability in cloud computing resembles the early Internet era, when there was no common agreement on the protocols and technologies used and each organization had its own network. Yet the first steps toward a standardization process have been made, and a few organizations, such as the Cloud Computing Interoperability Forum (CCIF), *David Linthicum, Cloud Computing Ontology Framework; http://Cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/811519. 9www.Cloudforum.org. \\n\\n4.5 Open challenges. 137 the Open Cloud Consortium,1 and the DMTF Cloud Standards Incubator,l1 are leading the path. various stakeholders on the benefits of open standards in the field. The standardization efforts are mostly concerned with the lower level of the cloud computing architecture, which is the most popular and developed. In particular, in the IaaS market, the use of a proprietary virtual machine format constitutes the major reasons for the vendor lock-in, and efforts to provide virtual machine image compatibility between IaaS vendors can possibly improve the level of interoperability among them. The Open Virtualization Format (OVF) [51] is an attempt to provide a common format for storing the information and metadata describing a virtual machine image. Even though the OVF provides a full specification for packaging and distributing virtual use it to import static virtual machine images. The challenge is providing standards for supporting the migration of running instances, thus allowing the real ability of switching from one infrastruc- ture vendor to another in a completely transparent manner. Another direction in which standards try to move is devising a general reference architecture for cloud computing systems and providing a standard interface through which one can interact with them. At the moment the compatibility between different solutions is quite restricted, and the lack of a common set of APIs make the interaction with cloud-based solutions vendor specific. In the IaaS market, Amazon Web Services plays a leading role, and other IaaS solutions, mostly open source, provide AWS-compatible APIs, thus constituting themselves as valid alternatives. Even in this case, there is no consistent trend in devising some common APIs for interfacing with IaaS (and, in general, XaaS), and this constitutes one of the areas in which a considerable improvement can be made in the future. 4.5.3 Scalability and fault tolerance The ability to scale on demand constitutes one of the most attractive features of cloud computing. Clouds allow scaling beyond the limits of the existing in-house IT resources, whether they are infrastructure (compute and storage) or applications services. To implement such a capability, the cloud middleware has to be designed with the principle of scalability along different dimensions in mind-for example, performance, size, and load. The cloud middleware manages a huge number of resource and users, which rely on the cloud to obtain the horsepower that they cannot obtain within the premises without bearing considerable administrative and maintenance costs. These costs are a reality for whomever develops, manages, and maintains the cloud middleware and offers the service to customers. In this scenario, the ability to tolerate failure becomes fundamental, sometimes even more important than providing an extremely efficient and optimized system. Hence, the challenge in this case is designing highly scalable and fault-tolerant systems that are easy to manage and at the same time provide competitive performance. 10www.opencloudconsortium.org. 11www.dmtf.org/about/cloud-incubator. 12www.opencloudmanifesto.org.. \\n\\n138 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture 4.5.4 Security, trust, and privacy. Security, trust, and privacy issues are major obstacles for massive adoption of cloud computing The traditional cryptographic technologies are used to prevent data tampering and access to sensi- tive information. The massive use of virtualization technologies exposes the existing system to new threats, which previously were not considered applicable. For example, it might be possible that applications hosted in the cloud can process sensitive information; such information can be stored within a cloud storage facility using the most advanced technology in cryptography to protect data and then be considered safe from any attempt to access it without the required permissions Although these data are processed in memory, they must necessarily be decrypted by the legitimate application, but since the application is hosted in a managed virtual environment it becomes acces- sible to the virtual machine manager that by program is designed to access the memory pages of such an application. In this case, what is experienced is a lack of control over the environment in which the application is executed, which is made possible by leveraging the cloud. It then happens that a new way of using existing technologies creates new opportunities for additional threats to the security of applications. The lack of control over their own data and processes also poses severe problems for the trust we give to the cloud service provider and the level of privacy we want to have for our data.. On one side we need to decide whether to trust the provider itself; on the other side, specific regulations can simply prevail over the agreement the provider is willing to establish with us con- cerning the privacy of the information managed on our behalf. Moreover, cloud services delivered to the end user can be the result of a complex stack of services that are obtained by third parties via the primary cloud service provider. In this case there is a chain of responsibilities in terms of service delivery that can introduce more vulnerability for the secure management of data, the enforcement of privacy rules, and the trust given to the service provider. In particular, when a vio- lation of privacy or illegal access to sensitive information is detected, it could become difficult to identify who is liable for such violations. The challenges in this area are, then, mostly concerned with devising secure and trustable systems from different perspectives: technical, social, and legal. 4.5.5 Organizational aspects Cloud computing introduces a significant change in the way IT services are consumed and man- aged. More precisely, storage, compute power, network infrastructure, and applications are deliv- ered as metered services over the Internet. This introduces a billing model that is new within typical enterprise IT departments, which requires a certain level of cultural and organizational pro- cess maturity. In particular, a wide acceptance of cloud computing will require a significant change. to business processes and organizational boundaries. Some interesting questions arise in considering the role of the IT department in this new scenario. In particular, the following questions have to be considered: What is the new role of the IT department in an enterprise that completely or significantly relies on the cloud?. How will the compliance department perform its activity when there is a considerable lack of control over application workflows? \\n\\nReview questions 139 What are the implications (political, legal, etc.) for organizations that lose control over some aspects of their services? What will be the perception of the end users of such services?. From an organizational point of view, the lack of control over the management of data and pro- cesses poses not only security threats but also new problems that previously did not exist Traditionally, when there was a problem with computer systems, organizations developed strategies and solutions to cope with them, often by relying on local expertise and knowledge. One of the major advantages of moving IT infrastructure and services to the cloud is to reduce or completely remove the costs related to maintenance and support. As a result, users of such infrastructure and services lose a reference to deal with for IT troubleshooting. At the same time, the existing IT staff is required to have a different kind of competency and, in general, fewer skills, thus reducing their value. These are the challenges from an organizational point of view that must be faced and that will significantly change the relationships within the enterprise itself among the various groups of people working together. SUMMARY In this chapter we discussed the fundamental characteristics of cloud computing and introduced ref- erence architecture for classifying and organizing cloud services. To best sum up the content of this chapter, we can recall the NIST working definition of cloud computing, which outlines the funda- mental aspects of this phenomenon as follows: Five essential characteristics. In-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling rapid elasticity, and measured service.. Three service models.  Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).  Four deployment models. Public clouds, private clouds, community clouds, and hybrid clouds. The major driving force for rapid adoption of cloud computing are the economics and the sim- plicity of software delivery and operation. Cloud computing presents considerable opportunity to increase the profits of enterprises by reducing capital costs of IT assets and transforming them into operational costs. For these reasons we have also discussed the economic and cost models intro- duced with cloud computing. Although cloud computing has been rapidly adopted in industry, there are several open research challenges in areas such as management of cloud computing systems, their security, and social and organizational issues. There is significant room for advancement in software infrastructure and models supporting cloud computing. Review questions 1. What does the acronym XaaS stand for?. 2.

How does it introduce innovation into the field of distributed computing? This chapter addresses all these questions and characterizes the phenomenon. It provides a reference model that serves as a basis for discussion of cloud computing technologies. .Introduction Utility-oriented data centers are the first outcome of cloud computing, and they serve as the infra structure through which the services are implemented and delivered. Any cloud service, whether virtual hardware, development platform, or application software, relies on a distributed infrastruc ture owned by the provider or rented from a third party. As noted in the previous definition, the characterization of a cloud is quite general: It can be implemented using a datacenter, a collection of clusters, or a heterogeneous distributed system composed of desktop PCs, workstations, and ser vers. Commonly, clouds are built by relying on one or more datacenters. In most cases hardware resources are virtualized to provide isolation of workloads and to best exploit the infrastructure. According to the specific service delivered to the end user, different layers can be stacked on top of the virtual infrastructure: a virtual machine manager, a development platform, or a specific application middleware. As noted in earlier chapters, the cloud computing paradigm emerged as a result of the convergence of various existing models, technologies, and concepts that changed the way we deliver and use IT services. A broad definition of the phenomenon could be as follows: Cloud computing is a utility-oriented and Internet-centric way of delivering IT services on demand. These services cover the entire computing stack: from the hardware infrastructure packaged as a set of virtual machines to software services such as development platforms and distributed applications. This definition captures the most important and fundamental aspects of cloud computing. We now discuss a reference model that aids in categorization of cloud technologies, applications, and services.  Cloud Computing Architecture .The cloud reference model Cloud computing supports any IT service that can be consumed as a utility and delivered through a network, most likely the Internet. Such characterization includes quite different aspects: infrastructure, development platforms, application and services. ..Architecture It is possible to organize all the concrete realizations of cloud computing into a layered view covering the entire stack (see Figure .), from hardware appliances to software systems. Cloud resources are harnessed to offer \"computing horsepower\"\\' required for providing services. Often, this layer is implemented using a datacenter in which hundreds and thousands of nodes are stacked together. Cloud infrastructure can be heterogeneous in nature because a variety of resources, such as clusters and even networked PCs, can be used to build it. Moreover, database systems and other storage services can also be part of the infrastructure. The physical infrastructure is managed by the core middleware, the objectives of which are to provide an appropriate runtime environment for applications and to best utilize resources. At the bottom of the stack, virtualization technologies are used to guarantee runtime environment customization, application isolation, sandboxing, and quality of service. Hardware virtualization is most commonly used at this level. Hypervisors manage the pool of resources and expose the distributed infrastructure as a collection of virtual machines. By using virtual machine technology it is possible to finely partition the hardware resources such as CPU and memory and to virtualize specific devices, thus meeting the requirements of users and applications. This solution is generally paired  PureSaaS Cloud Applications  SaaS User Applications Social Computing, Enterprise ISV, ScientificComputing, CDNs PurePaaS Cloud Programming Environment and Tools PaaS User-level Web ., Mashups, Concurrent and Distributed Programming.e  Middleware Workflows , Libraries, Scripting laaS Cloud Hosting Platforms laaS(M) QoS Negotiation, Admission ControlPricing, SLA Management, Monitoring, Execution Management, Metering, Accounting. Core  Middleware Virtual Machine (VM), VM Management and Deployment Cloud Resources System Infrastructure FIGURE .The cloud computing architecture. \\n\\n.The cloud reference model with storage and network virtualization strategies, which allow the infrastructure to be completely virtualized and controlled. According to the specific service offered to end users, other virtualization techniques can be used; for example, programming-level virtualization helps in creating a portable runtime environment where applications can be run and controlled. This scenario generally implies that applications hosted in the cloud be developed with a specific technology or a programming language, such as Java, .NET, or Python. In this case, the user does not have to build its system from bare metal. Infrastructure management is the key function of core middleware, which supports capabilities such as negotiation of the quality of service, admission control, execution management and monitoring, accounting, and billing. The combination of cloud hosting platforms and resources is generally classified as a Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution. We can organize the different examples of IaaS into two categories: Some of them provide both the management layer and the physical infrastructure; others provide only the management layer (IaaS (M)). In this second case, the management layer is often integrated with other IaaS solutions that provide physical infrastructure and adds value to them. IaaS solutions are suitable for designing the system infrastructure but provide limited services to build applications. Such service is provided by cloud programming environments and tools which form a new layer for offering users a development platform for applications. The range of tools include Web-based interfaces, command-line tools, and frameworks for concurrent and distributed programming. In this scenario, users develop their applications specifically for the cloud by using the API exposed at the user-level middleware. For this reason, this approach is also known as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) because the service offered to the user is a development platform rather than an infrastructure. PaaS solutions generally include the infrastructure as well, which is bundled as part of the service provided to users. In the case of Pure PaaS, only the user-level middleware is offered, and it has to be complemented with a virtual or physical infrastructure. The top layer of the reference model depicted in Figure .contains services delivered at the application level. These are mostly referred to as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). In most cases these are Web-based applications that rely on the cloud to provide service to end users. The horsepower of the cloud provided by IaaS and PaaS solutions allows independent software vendors to deliver their application services over the Internet. Other applications belonging to this layer are those that strongly leverage the Internet for their core functionalities that rely on the cloud to sustain a larger number of users; this is the case of gaming portals and, in general, social networking websites. As a vision, any service offered in the cloud computing style should be able to adaptively change and expose an autonomic behavior, in particular for its availability and performance. As a reference model, it is then expected to have an adaptive management layer in charge of elastically scaling on demand. SaaS implementations should feature such behavior automatically, whereas PaaS and IaaS generally provide this functionality as a part of the API exposed to users. The reference model described in Figure .also introduces the concept of everything as a Service (XaaS). This is one of the most important elements of cloud computing: Cloud services from different providers can be combined to provide a completely integrated solution covering all the computing stack of a system. IaaS providers can offer the bare metal in terms of virtual machines where PaaS solutions are deployed. When there is no need for a PaaS layer, it is possible to directly customize the virtual infrastructure with the software stack needed to run applications. This is the case of virtual Web farms: a distributed system composed of Web servers, database \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture. servers, and load balancers on top of which prepackaged software is installed to run Web applica tions. This possibility has made cloud computing an interesting option for reducing startups\\' capital investment in IT, allowing them to quickly commercialize their ideas and grow their infrastructure according to their revenues. Table .summarizes the characteristics of the three major categories used to classify cloud computing solutions. In the following section, we briefly discuss these characteristics along with some references to practical implementations. ..Infrastructureand hardware-as-a-service. Infrastructureand Hardware-as-a-Service (IaaS/HaaS) solutions are the most popular and developed market segment of cloud computing. They deliver customizable infrastructure on demand. The available options within the IaaS offering umbrella range from single servers to entire infrastructures, including network devices, load balancers, and database and Web servers. The main technology used to deliver and implement these solutions is hardware virtualization: one or more virtual machines opportunely configured and interconnected define the distributed system on top of which applications are installed and deployed. Virtual machines also constitute the atomic components that are deployed and priced according to the specific features of the virtual hardware: memory, number of processors, and disk storage. IaaS/HaaS solutions bring all the benefits of hardware virtualization: workload partitioning, application isolation, sandboxing, and hardware tuning. From the perspective of the service provider, IaaS/HaaS allows better exploiting the IT infrastructure and provides a more secure environment where executing third party applications. From the perspective of the customer it reduces the administration and maintenance cost as well as the capital costs allocated to purchase hardware. At the same time, users can take advantage of the full customization offered by virtualization to deploy their infrastructure in the cloud; in most cases virtual machines come with only the selected operating system installed and the system can be Table .Cloud Computing Services Classification.

Other solutions provide prepackaged system images that already contain the software stack required for the most common uses: Web servers, database servers, or LAMP\\' stacks. Besides the basic virtual machine management capabilities, additional services can be provided, generally including the following: SLA resource-based allocation, workload management, support for infrastructure design through advanced Web interfaces, and the ability to integrate third-party IaaS solutions.. Figure .provides an overall view of the components forming an Infrastructure-as-a-Service solution. It is possible to distinguish three principal layers: the physical infrastructure, the software management infrastructure, and the user interface. At the top layer the user interface provides access to the services exposed by the software management infrastructure. Such an interface is Web-Based Management Interface Web Services, Portals, REST API Infrastructure Management Software  Pricing / Billing QoS SLA Management Scheduling  Provisioning Monitoring Reservation  VM Image Repository VM Pool Managemen Physical Infrastructure Datacenter Cluster Desktop / Heterogeneous Resourcese Third-Party laaS Cloud. FIGURE .Infrastructure-as-a-Service reference implementation. \\'LAMP is an acronym for Linux Apache MySql and PHP and identifies a specific server configuration running the Linux operating system, featuring Apache as Web server, MySQL as database server, and PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) as server-side scripting technology for developing Web applications. LAMP stacks are the most common packaged solutions for quickly deploying Web applications. \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture generally based on Web .technologies: Web services, RESTful APIs, and mash-ups. These technologies allow either applications or final users to access the services exposed by the underlying infrastructure. Web .applications allow developing full-featured management consoles completely hosted in a browser or a Web page. Web services and RESTful APIs allow programs to interact with the service without human intervention, thus providing complete integration within a software system. The core features of an IaaS solution are implemented in the infrastructure management software layer. In particular, management of the virtual machines is the most important function performed by this layer. A central role is played by the scheduler, which is in charge of allocating the execution of virtual machine instances. The scheduler interacts with the other components that perform a variety of tasks: The pricing and billing component takes care of the cost of executing each virtual machine instance and maintains data that will be used to charge the user.. The monitoring component tracks the execution of each virtual machine instance and maintains data required for reporting and analyzing the performance of the system..  The reservation component stores the information of all the virtual machine instances that have been executed or that will be executed in the future.. If support for QoS-based execution is provided, a QoS/sLA management component will maintain a repository of all the SLAs made with the users; together with the monitoring component, this component is used to ensure that a given virtual machine instance is executed with the desired quality of service. The VM repository component provides a catalog of virtual machine images that users can use to create virtual instances. Some implementations also allow users to upload their specific virtual machine images.  A VM pool manager component is responsible for keeping track of all the live instances Finally, if the system supports the integration of additional resources belonging to a third-party IaaS provider, a provisioning component interacts with the scheduler to provide a virtual machine instance that is external to the local physical infrastructure directly managed by the pool. The bottom layer is composed of the physical infrastructure, on top of which the management layer operates. As previously discussed, the infrastructure can be of different types; the specific infrastructure used depends on the specific use of the cloud. A service provider will most likely use a massive datacenter containing hundreds or thousands of nodes. A cloud infrastructure developed in house, in a small or medium-sized enterprise or within a university department, will most likely rely on a cluster. At the bottom of the scale it is also possible to consider a heterogeneous environcase mostly represents an evolution of desktop grids where any available computing resource (such as PCs and workstations that are idle outside of working hours) is harnessed to provide a huge compute power. From an architectural point of view, the physical layer also includes the virtual resources that are rented from external IaaS providers.. In the case of complete IaaS solutions, all three levels are offered as service. This is generally the case with public clouds vendors such as Amazon, GoGrid, Joyent, Rightscale, Terremark. Rackspace, ElasticHosts, and Flexiscale, which own large datacenters and give access to their computing infrastructures using an IaaS approach. Other solutions instead cover only the user interface \\n\\n.The cloud reference model. and the infrastructure software management layers. They need to provide credentials to access third-party IaaS providers or to own a private infrastructure in which the management software is installed. This is the case with Enomaly, Elastra, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, and specific IaaS (M) solutions from VMware, IBM, and Microsoft. The proposed architecture only represents a reference model for IaaS implementations. It has. been used to provide general insight into the most common features of this approach for providing cloud computing services and the operations commonly implemented at this level. Different solutions can feature additional services or even not provide support for some of the features discussed here. Finally, the reference architecture applies to IaaS implementations that provide computing resources, especially for the scheduling component. If storage is the main service provided, it is still possible to distinguish these three layers. The role of infrastructure management software is not to keep track and manage the execution of virtual machines but to provide access to large infrastructures and implement storage virtualization solutions on top of the physical layer.. ..Platform as a service. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions provide a development and deployment platform for running applications in the cloud. They constitute the middleware on top of which applications are built. A general overview of the features characterizing the PaaS approach is given in Figure .. Web-Based Interface Web Services, Portals, REST API. Programming API / Libraries PaaS Core Middleware User Elasticity &  Management  Scaling Runtime Application O Management QoS / SLA Management &  Resources Management Billing Physical Infrastructure. laaS Providers FIGURE .The Platform-as-a-Service reference model.. \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture Application management is the core functionality of the middleware. PaaS implementations provide applications with a runtime environment and do not expose any service for managing the underlying infrastructure. They automate the process of deploying applications to the infrastructure, configuring application components, provisioning and configuring supporting technologies such as load balancers and databases, and managing system change based on policies set by the user. Developers design their systems in terms of applications and are not concerned with hardware (physical or virtual), operating systems, and other low-level services. The core middleware is in charge of managing the resources and scaling applications on demand or automatically, according to the commitments made with users. From a user point of view, the core middleware exposes interfaces that allow programming and deploying applications on the cloud. These can be in the form of a Web-based interface or in the form of programming APIs and libraries. The specific development model decided for applications determines the interface exposed to the user. Some implementations provide a completely Web-based interface hosted in the cloud and offering a variety of services. It is possible to find integrated developed environments based on GL and visual programming concepts, or rapid prototyping environments where applications are. built by assembling mash-ups and user-defined components and successively customized. Other implementations of the PaaS model provide a complete object model for representing an application and provide a programming language-based approach. This approach generally offers more flexibility and opportunities but incurs longer development cycles. Developers generally have the full power of programming languages such as Java, .NET, Python, or Ruby, with some restrictions to provide better scalability and security. In this case the traditional development environments can be used to design and develop applications, which are then deployed on the cloud by using the APIs exposed by the PaaS provider. Specific components can be offered together with the development libraries for better exploiting the services offered by the PaaS environment. Sometimes a local runtime environment that simulates the conditions of the cloud is given to users for testing their applications before deployment. This environment can be restricted in terms of features, and it is generally not optimized for scaling.. PaaS solutions can offer middleware for developing applications together with the infrastructure or simply provide users with the software that is installed on the user premises. In the first case, the PaaS provider also owns large datacenters where applications are executed; in the second case, referred to in this book as Pure PaaS, the middleware constitutes the core value of the offering. It is also possible to have vendors that deliver both middleware and infrastructure and ship only the middleware for private installations. Table .provides a classification of the most popular PaaS implementations. It is possible to organize the various solutions into three wide categories: PaaS-I, PaaS-II, and PaaS-III. The first category identifies PaaS implementations that completely follow the cloud computing style for application development and deployment. They offer an integrated development environment hosted within the Web browser where applications are designed, developed, composed, and deployed. This is the case of Force.com and Longjump. Both deliver as platforms the combination of middleware and infrastructure. In the second class we can list all those solutions that are focused on providing a scalable infrastructure for Web application, mostly websites. In this case, developers generally use the providers\\' APIs, which are built on top of industrial runtimes, to develop \\n\\n.The cloud reference model Table .Platform-as-a-Service Offering Classification Vendors and Category Description Product Type Products PaaS-I Runtime environment with Web-hosted Middleware + Infrastructure Force.com application development platform.

It provides a scalable runtime based on the Java and Python programming languages, which have been modified for pro viding a secure runtime environment and enriched with additional APIs and components to support scalability. AppScale, an open-source implementation of Google AppEngine, provides interface. compatible middleware that has to be installed on a physical infrastructure. Joyent Smart Platform provides a similar approach to Google AppEngine. A different approach is taken by Heroku and Engine Yard, which provide scalability support for Rubyand Ruby on Rails-based Websites. In this case developers design and create their applications with the traditional methods and then deploy them by uploading to the provider\\'s platform. The third category consists of all those solutions that provide a cloud programming platform for any kind of application, not only Web applications. Among these, the most popular is Microsoft Windows Azure, which provides a comprehensive framework for building service oriented cloud applications on top of the .NET technology, hosted on Microsoft\\'s datacenters. Other solutions in the same category, such as Manjrasoft Aneka, Apprenda SaaSGrid, Appistry Cloud IQ Platform, DataSynapse, and GigaSpaces DataGrid, provide only middleware with differ ent services. Table .shows only a few options available in the Platform-as-a-Service market segment. The PaaS umbrella encompasses a variety of solutions for developing and hosting applications in the cloud. Despite this heterogeneity, it is possible to identify some criteria that are expected to \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture be found in any implementation. As noted by Sam Charrington, product manager at Appistry.com, there are some essential characteristics that identify a PaaS solution:. Runtime framework. This framework represents the \"software stack\" of the PaaS model and the most intuitive aspect that comes to people\\'s minds when they refer to PaaS solutions. The runtime framework executes end-user code according to the policies set by the user and the provider. Abstraction. PaaS solutions are distinguished by the higher level of abstraction that they provide. Whereas in the case of IaaS solutions the focus is on delivering \"raw\\' access to virtual or physical infrastructure, in the case of PaaS the focus is on the applications the cloud must support. This means that PaaS solutions offer a way to deploy and manage applications on the cloud rather than a bunch of virtual machines on top of which the IT infrastructure is built and configured. Automation. PaaS environments automate the process of deploying applications to the infrastructure, scaling them by provisioning additional resources when needed. This process is performed automatically and according to the SLA made between the customers and the provider. This feature is normally not native in IaaS solutions, which only provide ways to provision more resources. Cloud services. PaaS offerings provide developers and architects with services and APIs. helping them to simplify the creation and delivery of elastic and highly available cloud applications. These services are the key differentiators among competing PaaS solutions and generally include specific components for developing applications, advanced services for application monitoring, management, and reporting. Another essential component for a PaaS-based approach is the ability to integrate third-party cloud services offered from other vendors by leveraging service-oriented architecture. Such integration should happen through standard interfaces and protocols. This opportunity makes the development of applications more agile and able to evolve according to the needs of customers and users. Many of the PaaS offerings provide this facility, which is naturally built into the framework they leverage to provide a cloud computing solution.. One of the major concerns of leveraging PaaS solutions for implementing applications is vendor lock-in. Differently from IaaS solutions, which deliver bare virtual servers that can be fully customized in terms of the software stack installed, PaaS environments deliver a platform for developing applications, which exposes a well-defined set of APIs and, in most cases, binds the application to the specific runtime of the PaaS provider. Even though a platform-based approach strongly simplifies the development and deployment cycle of applications, it poses the risk of making these applications completely dependent on the provider. Such dependency can become a significant obstacle in retargeting the application to another environment and runtime if the commitments made with the provider cease. The impact of the vendor lock-in on applications obviously varies according to the various solutions. Some of them, such as Force.com, rely on a proprietary runtime framework which makes the retargeting process very difficult. Others, such as Google AppEngine and Microsoft Azure, rely on industry-standard runtimes but utilize private data storage facilities and The full detail of this analysis can be found in the Cloud-pulse blog post available at the following address: http:// Cloudpulseblog.com///the-essential-characteristics-of-paas. \\n\\n.The cloud reference model computing infrastructure. In this case it is possible to find alternatives based on PaaS solutions implementing the same interfaces, with perhaps different performance. Others, such as Appistry Cloud IQ Platform, Heroku, and Engine Yard, completely rely on open standards, thus making the migration of applications easier. Finally, from a financial standpoint, although IaaS solutions allow shifting the capital cost into operational costs through outsourcing, PaaS solutions can cut the cost across development, deploy. ment, and management of applications. It helps management reduce the risk of ever-changing technologies by offloading the cost of upgrading the technology to the PaaS provider. This happens transparently for the consumers of this model, who can concentrate their effort on the core value of their business. The PaaS approach, when bundled with underlying IaaS solutions, helps even small start-up companies quickly offer customers integrated solutions on a hosted platform at a very minimal cost. These opportunities make the PaaS offering a viable option that targets different market segments. ..Software as a service Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a software delivery model that provides access to applications through the Internet as a Web-based service. It provides a means to free users from complex hardware and software management by offloading such tasks to third parties, which build applications accessible to multiple users through a Web browser. In this scenario, customers neither need install anything on their premises nor have to pay considerable up-front costs to purchase the software and the required licenses. They simply access the application website, enter their credentials and billing details, and can instantly use the application, which, in most of the cases, can be further customized for their needs. On the provider side, the specific details and features of each customer\\'s applica tion are maintained in the infrastructure and made available on demand. The SaaS model is appealing for applications serving a wide range of users and that can be adapted to specific needs with little further customization. This requirement characterizes SaaS as a \"one-to-many\" software delivery model, whereby an application is shared across multiple users This is the case of CRM\\' and ERP\\' applications that constitute common needs for almost all enterprises, from small to medium-sized and large business. Every enterprise will have the same requirements for the basic features concerning CRM and ERP; different needs can be satisfied with further customization. This scenario facilitates the development of software platforms that provide a general set of features and support specialization and ease of integration of new components Moreover, it constitutes the perfect candidate for hosted solutions, since the applications delivered to the user are the same, and the applications themselves provide users with the means to shape the CRM is an acronym for customer relationship management and identifies concerns related to interactions with customers and prospect sales. CRM solutions are software systems that simplify the process of managing customers and identifying sales strategies. ERP, an acronym for enterprise resource planning, generally refers to an integrated computer-based system used to manage internal and external resources, including tangible assets, materials, and financial and human resources. ERP software provides an integrated view of the enterprise and facilitates the management of the information flows between business functions and resources. \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture applications according to user needs. As a result, SaaS applications are naturally multitenant. Multitenancy, which is a feature of SaaS compared to traditional packaged software, allows providers to centralize and sustain the effort of managing large hardware infrastructures, maintaining and upgrading applications transparently to the users, and optimizing resources by sharing the costs among the large user base. On the customer side, such costs constitute a minimal fraction of the usage fee paid for the software.. As noted previously (see Section .), the concept of software as a service preceded cloud computing, starting to circulate at the end of the s, when it began to gain marketplace acceptance []. The acronym SaaS was then coined in by the Software Information & Industry Association (SIIA) [] with the following connotation: In the software as a service model, the application, or service, is deployed from a centralized datacenter across a network-Internet, Intranet, LAN, or VPN-providing access and use on a the applications from a central provider. Business models vary according to the level to which the software is streamlined, to lower price and increase efficiency, or value-added through cus-. tomization to further improve digitized business processes. The analysis carried out by SIA was mainly oriented to cover application service providers (ASPs) and all their variations, which capture the concept of software applications consumed as a service in a broader sense. ASPs already had some of the core characteristics of SaaS: . The product sold to customer is application access.  The application is centrally managed. The service delivered is one-to-many.  The service delivered is an integrated solution delivered on the contract, which means provided as promised. Initially ASPs offered hosting solutions for packaged applications, which were served to multiple customers. Successively, other options, such as Web-based integration of third-party application services, started to gain interest and a new range of opportunities open up to independent software vendors and service providers. These opportunities eventually evolved into a more flexible model to deliver applications as a service: the SaaS model. ASPs provided access to packaged software solutions that addressed the needs of a variety of customers. Initially this approach was affordable for service providers, but it later became inconvenient when the cost of customizations and specializations increased. The SaaS approach introduces a more flexible way of delivering application ser vices that are fully customizable by the user by integrating new services, injecting their own components, and designing the application and information workflows. Such a new approach has also been possible with the support of Web .technologies, which allowed turning the Web browser into a full-featured interface, able even to support application composition and development. How is cloud computing related to Saas? According to the classification of services shown in Figure ., the SaaS approach lays on top of the cloud computing stack. It fits into the cloud computing vision expressed by the XaaS acronym, Everything-as-a-Service; and with SaaS, applications \\n\\n.The cloud reference model are delivered as a service. Initially the SaaS model was of interest only for lead users and early adopters. The benefits delivered at that stage were the following:. Software cost reduction and total cost of ownership (TCO) were paramount  Service-level improvements  Rapid implementation Standalone and configurable applications.  Rudimentary application and data integration.  Subscription and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pricing With the advent of cloud computing there has been an increasing acceptance of SaaS as a viable software delivery model. This led to transition into SaaS .[], which does not introduce a new technology but transforms the way in which SaaS is used.. In particular, SaaS .is focused on providing a more robust infrastructure and application plat forms driven by SLAs. Rather than being characterized as a more rapid implementation and deploy ment environment, SaaS .will focus on the rapid achievement of business objectives. This is why such evolution does not introduce any new technology: The existing technologies are composed together in order to achieve business goals efficiently. Fundamental to this perspective is the ability to leverage existing solutions and integrate value-added business services. The existing SaaS infrastructures not only allow the development and customization of applications, but they also facilitate the integration of services that are exposed by other parties. SaaS applications are then the result of the interconnection and the synergy of different applications and components that together provide customers with added value. This approach dramatically changes the software ecosystem of the SaaS market, which is no longer monopolized by a few vendors but is now a fully interconnected network of service providers, clustered around some \"big hubs\"\\' that deliver the application to the customer. In this scenario, each single component integrated into the SaaS application becomes responsible to the user for ensuring the attached SLA and at the same time could be priced differently. Customers can then choose how to specialize their applications by deciding which com ponents and services they want to integrate. Software-as-a-Service applications can serve different needs. CRM, ERP, and social networking applications are definitely the most popular ones. SalesForce.com is probably the most successful and popular example of a CRM service. It provides a wide range of services for applications: customer relationship and human resource management, enterprise resource planning, and many other features. SalesForce.com builds on top of the Force.com platform, which provides a fully featured environment for building applications. It offers either a programming language or a visual environment to arrange components together for building applications. In addition to the basic features provided, the integration with third-party-made applications enriches SalesForce.com\\'s value. In particular, through AppExchange customers can publish, search, and integrate new services and features into their existing applications. This makes SalesForce.com applications completely extensible and customizable Similar solutions are offered by NetSuite and RightNow. NetSuite is an integrated software business suite featuring financials, CRM, inventory, and ecommerce functionalities integrated all together. RightNow is customer experience-centered SaaS application that integrates together different features, from chat to Web communities, to support the common activity of an enterprise. \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture Another important class of popular SaaS applications comprises social networking applications such as Facebook and professional networking sites such as LinkedIn. Other than providing the basic features of networking, they allow incorporating and extending their capabilities by integrating third-party applications. These can be developed as plug-ins for the hosting platform, as happens for Facebook, and made available to users, who can select which applications they want to add to their profile. As a result, the integrated applications get full access to the network of contacts and users\\' profile data. The nature of these applications can be of different types: office automation components, games, or integration with other existing services.. Office automation applications are also an important representative for SaaS applications: Google Documents and Zoho Office are examples of Web-based applications that aim to address all user needs for documents, spreadsheets, and presentation management. They offer a Web-based interface for creating, managing, and modifying documents that can be easily shared among users and made accessible from anywhere. It is important to note the role of SaaS solution enablers, which provide an environment in which to integrate third-party services and share information with others. A quite successful example is Box.net, an SaaS application providing users with a Web space and profile that can be enriched and extended with third-party applications such as office automation, integration with CRM-based solutions, social Websites, and photo editing.. .Types of clouds Clouds constitute the primary outcome of cloud computing. They are a type of parallel and distrib uted system harnessing physical and virtual computers presented as a unified computing resource. Clouds build the infrastructure on top of which services are implemented and delivered to customers. Such infrastructures can be of different types and provide useful information about the nature and the services offered by the cloud. A more useful classification is given according to the administrative domain of a cloud: It identifies the boundaries within which cloud computing services are implemented, provides hints on the underlying infrastructure adopted to support such services, and qualifies them. It is then possible to differentiate four different types of cloud: Public clouds. The cloud is open to the wider public.. Private clouds. The cloud is implemented within the private premises of an institution and generally made accessible to the members of the institution or a subset of them.. Hybrid or heterogeneous clouds. The cloud is a combination of the two previous solutions and most likely identifies a private cloud that has been augmented with resources or services hosted in a public cloud. Community clouds. The cloud is characterized by a multi-administrative domain involving different deployment models (public, private, and hybrid), and it is specifically designed to address the needs of a specific industry. Almost all the implementations of clouds can be classified in this categorization. In the following sections, we provide brief characterizations of these clouds.. \\n\\n.Types of clouds ..Public clouds Public clouds constitute the first expression of cloud computing. They are a realization of the canonical view of cloud computing in which the services offered are made available to anyone. from anywhere, and at any time through the Internet. From a structural point of view they are a distributed system, most likely composed of one or more datacenters connected together, on top of which the specific services offered by the cloud are implemented. Any customer can easily sign in with the cloud provider, enter her credential and billing details, and use the services offered. Historically, public clouds were the first class of cloud that were implemented and offered They offer solutions for minimizing IT infrastructure costs and serve as a viable option for handling peak loads on the local infrastructure. They have become an interesting option for small enterprises, which are able to start their businesses without large up-front investments by completely relying on public infrastructure for their IT needs. What made attractive public clouds compared to the reshap. ing of the private premises and the purchase of hardware and software was the ability to grow or shrink according to the needs of the related business. By renting the infrastructure or subscribing to application services, customers were able to dynamically upsize or downsize their IT according to the demands of their business. Currently, public clouds are used both to completely replace the IT infrastructure of enterprises and to extend it when it is required.. A fundamental characteristic of public clouds is multitenancy. A public cloud is meant to serve a multitude of users, not a single customer. Any customer requires a virtual computing environment that is separated, and most likely isolated, from other users. This is a fundamental requirement to provide effective monitoring of user activities and guarantee the desired performance and the other QoS attributes negotiated with users. QoS management is a very important aspect of public clouds. Hence, a significant portion of the software infrastructure is devoted to monitoring the cloud resources, to bill them according to the contract made with the user, and to keep a complete history of cloud usage for each customer. These features are fundamental to public clouds because they help providers offer services to users with full accountability.. A public cloud can offer any kind of service: infrastructure, platform, or applications. For example, Amazon ECis a public cloud that provides infrastructure as a service; Google AppEngine is a public cloud that provides an application development platform as a service; and SalesForce.com is a public cloud that provides software as a service. What makes public clouds peculiar is the way they are consumed: They are available to everyone and are generally architected to support a large quantity of users. What characterizes them is their natural ability to scale on demand and sustain peak loads. From an architectural point of view there is no restriction concerning the type of distributed system implemented to support public clouds. Most likely, one or more datacenters constitute the physical infrastructure on top of which the services are implemented and delivered. Public clouds can be composed of geographically dispersed datacenters to share the load of users and better serve them according to their locations. For example, Amazon Web Services has datacenters installed in the United States, Europe, Singapore, and Australia; they allow their customers to choose between three different regions: us-west-, us-east-, or eu-west-. Such regions are priced differently and are further divided into availability zones, which map to specific datacenters. According to the spe cific class of services delivered by the cloud, a different software stack is installed to manage the infrastructure: virtual machine managers, distributed middleware, or distributed applications. \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture ..Private clouds Public clouds are appealing and provide a viable option to cut IT costs and reduce capital expenses. but they are not applicable in all scenarios. For example, a very common critique to the use of cloud computing in its canonical implementation is the loss of control. In the case of public clouds, the provider is in control of the infrastructure and, eventually, of the customers\\' core logic and sen sitive data. Even though there could be regulatory procedure in place that guarantees fair management and respect of the customer\\'s privacy, this condition can still be perceived as a threat or as an unacceptable risk that some organizations are not willing to take. In particular, institutions such as government and military agencies will not consider public clouds as an option for processing or storing their sensitive data. The risk of a breach in the security infrastructure of the provider could expose such information to others; this could simply be considered unacceptable. In other cases, the loss of control of where your virtual IT infrastructure resides could open the way to other problematic situations. More precisely, the geographical location of a datacenter generally determines the regulations that are applied to management of digital information. As a result, according to the specific location of data, some sensitive information can be made accessible to government agencies or even considered outside the law if processed with specific cryptographic techniques. For example, the USA PATRIOT Act provides its government and other agencies with virtually limitless powers to access information, including that belonging to any company that stores information in the U.S. territory. Finally, existing enterprises that have large computing infrastructures or large installed bases of software do not simply want to switch to public clouds, but they use the existing IT resources and optimize their revenue. All these aspects make the use of a public computing infrastructure not always possible. Yet the general idea supported by the cloud computing vision can still be attractive. More specifically, having an infrastructure able to deliver IT services on demand can still be a winning solution, even when implemented within the private premises of an institution. This idea led to the diffusion of private clouds, which are similar to public clouds, but their resource-provisioning model is limited within the boundaries of an Organization. Private clouds are virtual distributed systems that rely on a private infrastructure and provide internal users with dynamic provisioning of computing resources. Instead of a pay-as-you-go model as in public clouds, there could be other schemes in place, taking into account the usage of the cloud and proportionally billing the different departments or sections of an enterprise. Private clouds have the advantage of keeping the core business operations in-house by relying on the existing IT infrastructure and reducing the burden of maintaining it once the cloud has been set up. In this scenario, security concerns are less critical, since sensitive information does not flow out of the private infrastructure. Moreover, existing IT resources can be better utilized because the private cloud can provide services to a different range of users. Another interesting opportunity that comes with private clouds is the possibility of testing applications and systems at a comparatively lower The USA PATRIOT Act is a statute enacted by the U.S. government that increases the ability of law enforcement agencies to search telephone, email, medical, financial, and other records and eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States. The full text of the act is available at the Website of the Library of the Congress at the following address: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d:hr: (accessed April , ) \\n\\n.Types of clouds price rather than public clouds before deploying them on the public virtual infrastructure. A Forrester report [] on the benefits of delivering in-house cloud computing solutions for enterprises highlighted some of the key advantages of using a private cloud computing infrastructure: Customer information protection. Despite assurances by the public cloud leaders about security, few provide satisfactory disclosure or have long enough histories with their cloud offerings to provide warranties about the specific level of security put in place on their systems. In-house security is easier to maintain and rely on.. Infrastructure ensuring SLAs. Quality of service implies specific operations such as appropriate clustering and failover, data replication, system monitoring and maintenance, and disaster recovery, and other uptime services can be commensurate to the application needs. Although public cloud vendors provide some of these features, not all of them are available as needed. Compliance with standard procedures and operations. If organizations are subject to third-party compliance standards, specific procedures have to be put in place when deploying and executing applications. This could be not possible in the case of the virtual public infrastructure. All these aspects make the use of cloud-based infrastructures in private premises an interesting Option. From an architectural point of view, private clouds can be implemented on more heterogeneous hardware: They generally rely on the existing IT infrastructure already deployed on the private pre. mises. This could be a datacenter, a cluster, an enterprise desktop grid, or a combination of them The physical layer is complemented with infrastructure management software (i.e., IaaS (M); see Section ..) or a PaaS solution, according to the service delivered to the users of the cloud. Different options can be adopted to implement private clouds. Figure .provides a comprehensive view of the solutions together with some reference to the most popular software used to deploy private clouds. At the bottom layer of the software stack, virtual machine technologies such as Xen [], KVM [], and VMware serve as the foundations of the cloud. Virtual machine management technologies such as VMware vCloud, Eucalyptus [], and OpenNebula [] can be used to control the virtual infrastructure and provide an IaaS solution. VMware vCloud is a proprietary solution, but Eucalyptus provides full compatibility with Amazon Web Services interfaces and supports different virtual machine technologies such as Xen, KVM, and VMware. Like Eucalyptus, OpenNebula is an open-source solution for virtual infrastructure management that supports KVM, Xen, and VMware, which has been designed to easily integrate third-party IaaS providers. Its modular architecture allows extending the software with additional features such as the capability of reserving virtual machine instances by using Haizea [] as scheduler. Solutions that rely on the previous virtual machine managers and provide added value are OpenPEX [] and InterGrid []. OpenPEX is Web-based system that allows the reservation of virtual machine instances and is designed to support different back ends (at the moment only the support for Xen is implemented). InterGrid provides added value on top of OpenNebula and Amazon ECby allowing the reservation of virtual machine instances and managing multiadministrative domain clouds. PaaS solutions can provide an additional layer and deliver a high level service for private clouds. Among the options available for private deployment of clouds we can consider DataSynapse, Zimory Pools, Elastra, and Aneka. DataSynapse is a global provider of application virtualization software. By relying on the VMware virtualization technology, \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture Platform-as-a-Service Solutions DataSynapse, Zimory Pools, PaaS Elastra CloudServer, Aneka, ..... laaS Infrastructure Management Software Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, VMWare vCloud, OpenPEX, InterGrid, ....

DataSynapse provides a flexible environment for building private clouds on top of datacenters. Elastra Cloud Server is a platform for easily configuring and deploying distributed application infrastructures on clouds. Zimory provides a software infrastructure layer that automates the use of resource pools based on Xen, KVM, and VMware virtualization technologies. It allows creating an internal cloud composed of sparse private and public resources and provides facilities for migrating. applications within the existing infrastructure. Aneka is a software development platform that can be used to deploy a cloud infrastructure on top of heterogeneous hardware: datacenters, clusters, and desktop grids. It provides a pluggable service-oriented architecture that\\'s mainly devoted to supporting the execution of distributed applications with different programming models: bag of tasks, MapReduce, and others. Private clouds can provide in-house solutions for cloud computing, but if compared to public clouds they exhibit more limited capability to scale elastically on demand.. ..Hybrid clouds Public clouds are large software and hardware infrastructures that have a capability that is huge enough to serve the needs of multiple users, but they suffer from security threats and administrative pitfalls. Although the option of completely relying on a public virtual infrastructure is appealing for companies that did not incur IT capital costs and have just started considering their IT needs (i.e., start-ups), in most cases the private cloud option prevails because of the existing IT infrastructure. \\n\\n.Types of clouds Private clouds are the perfect solution when it is necessary to keep the processing of informa tion within an enterprise\\'s premises or it is necessary to use the existing hardware and software infrastructure. One of the major drawbacks of private deployments is the inability to scale on demand and to efficiently address peak loads. In this case, it is important to leverage capabilities of public clouds as needed. Hence, a hybrid solution could be an interesting opportunity for taking advantage of the best of the private and public worlds. This led to the development and diffusion of hybrid clouds. Hybrid clouds allow enterprises to exploit existing IT infrastructures, maintain sensitive infor mation within the premises, and naturally grow and shrink by provisioning external resources and releasing them when they\\'re no longer needed. Security concerns are then only limited to the public portion of the cloud that can be used to perform operations with less stringent constraints but that are still part of the system workload. Figure .provides a general overview of a hybrid cloud: It is a heterogeneous distributed system resulting from a private cloud that integrates additional services or resources from one or more public clouds. For this reason they are also called heterogeneous clouds. As depicted in the diagram, dynamic provisioning is a fundamental component in this scenario. Hybrid clouds address scalability issues by leveraging external resources for exceeding Hybrid / Heterogeneous Cloud Public Cloud Private Cloud Paas Dynamic  Provisioning laaS(M) Public Cloud Datacenter Cluster Desktop Grids NOWs FIGURE .Hybrid/heterogeneous cloud overview. \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture capacity demand. These resources or services are temporarily leased for the time required and then released. This practice is also known as cloudbursting. Whereas the concept of hybrid cloud is general, it mostly applies to IT infrastructure rather than software services. Service-oriented computing already introduces the concept of integration of paid software services with existing application deployed in the private premises. In an IaaS scenario, dynamic provisioning refers to the ability to acquire on demand virtual machines in order to increase the capability of the resulting distributed system and then release them. Infrastructure management software and PaaS solutions are the building blocks for deploying and managing hybrid clouds. In particular, with respect to private clouds, dynamic provisioning introduces a more complex scheduling algorithm and policies, the goal of which is also to optimize the budget spent to rent public resources. Infrastructure management software such as OpenNebula already exposes the capability of integrating resources from public clouds such as Amazon EC. In this case the virtual machine obtained from the public infrastructure is managed as all the other virtual machine instances maintained locally. What is missing is then an advanced scheduling engine that\\'s able to differentiate these resources and provide smart allocations by taking into account the budget available to extend the existing infrastructure. In the case of OpenNebula, advanced schedulers such as Haizea can be integrated to provide cost-based scheduling. A different approach is taken by InterGrid. This is essentially a distributed scheduling engine that manages the allocation of virtual machines in a collection of peer networks. Such networks can be represented by a local cluster, a gateway to a public cloud, or a combination of the two. Once a request is submitted to one of the InterGrid gateways, it is served by possibly allocating virtual instances in all the peered networks, and the allocation of requests is performed by taking into account the user budget and the peering arrangements between networks. Dynamic provisioning is most commonly implemented in PaaS solutions that support hybrid clouds. As previously discussed, one of the fundamental components of PaaS middleware is the mapping of distributed applications onto the cloud infrastructure. In this scenario, the role of dynamic provisioning becomes fundamental to ensuring the execution of applications under the QoS agreed on with the user. For example, Aneka provides a provisioning service that leverages different IaaS providers for scaling the existing cloud infrastructure []. The provisioning service cooperates with the scheduler, which is in charge of guaranteeing a specific QoS for applications. In particular, each user application has a budget attached, and the scheduler uses that budget to optimize the execution of the application by renting virtual nodes if needed. Other PaaS implementations support the deployment of hybrid clouds and provide dynamic provisioning capabilities Among those discussed for the implementation and management of private clouds we can cite Elastra CloudServer and Zimory Pools. According to the Cloud Computing Wiki, the term cloudburst has a double meaning; it also refers to the \"failure of a cloud computing environment due to the inability to handle a spike in demand\" (http://sites.google.com/site/ Cloudcomputingwiki/Home/Cloud-computing-vocabulary). In this book, we always refer to the dynamic provisioning of resources from public clouds when mentioning this term. \\n\\n.Types of clouds Community Cloud Infrastructure Application Services Third-Party Cloud Public Cloud Development Private Cloud  Platforms Public Cloud Private Cloud Federal and Government Bodies Private Users Industries Enterprises Public Services FIGURE .A community cloud. ..Community clouds Community clouds are distributed systems created by integrating the services of different clouds to address the specific needs of an industry, a community, or a business sector. The National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) [] characterizes community clouds as follows: The infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise.. Figure .provides a general view of the usage scenario of community clouds, together with reference architecture. The users of a specific community cloud fall into a well-identified community, sharing the same concerns or needs; they can be government bodies, industries, or even simple users, but all of them focus on the same issues for their interaction with the cloud. This is a different scenario than public clouds, which serve a multitude of users with different needs. Community clouds are also different from private clouds, where the services are generally delivered within the institution that owns the cloud.. From an architectural point of view, a community cloud is most likely implemented over multi ple administrative domains. This means that different organizations such as government bodies, \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture private enterprises, research organizations, and even public virtual infrastructure providers contribute with their resources to build the cloud infrastructure.. Candidate sectors for community clouds are as follows:  Media industry. In the media industry, companies are looking for low-cost, agile, and simple solutions to improve the efficiency of content production. Most media productions involve an extended ecosystem of partners. In particular, the creation of digital content is the outcome of a collaborative process that includes movement of large data, massive compute-intensive rendering tasks, and complex workflow executions. Community clouds can provide a shared environment where services can facilitate business-to-business collaboration and offer the media production. Healthcare industry. In the healthcare industry, there are different scenarios in which community clouds could be of use. In particular, community clouds can provide a global platform on which to share information and knowledge without revealing sensitive data maintained within the private infrastructure. The naturally hybrid deployment model of community clouds can easily support the storing of patient-related data in a private cloud while using the shared infrastructure for noncritical services and automating processes within hospitals. Energy and other core industries. In these sectors, community clouds can bundle the comprehensive set of solutions that together vertically address management, deployment, and orchestration of services and operations. Since these industries involve different providers, create an open and fair market. Public sector. Legal and political restrictions in the public sector can limit the adoption of public cloud offerings. Moreover, governmental processes involve several institutions and agencies and are aimed at providing strategic solutions at local, national, and international administrative levels. They involve business-to-administration, citizen-to-administration, and possibly business-to-business processes. Some examples include invoice approval, infrastructure planning, and public hearings. A community cloud can constitute the optimal venue to provide a distributed environment in which to create a communication platform for performing such operations. Scientific research. Science clouds are an interesting example of community clouds. In this case, the common interest driving different organizations sharing a large distributed infrastructure is scientific computing. The term community cloud can also identify a more specific type of cloud that arises from concern over the controls of vendors in cloud computing and that aspire to combine the principles of digital ecosystems\\' [] with the case study of cloud computing. A community cloud is formed by harnessing the underutilized resources of user machines [] and providing an infrastructure in \\'Digital ecosystems are distributed, adaptive, and open sociotechnical systems with properties of self-organization, scalability, and sustainability inspired by natural ecosystems. The primary aim of digital ecosystems is to sustain the regional development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \\n\\n.Economics of the cloud. which each can be at the same time a consumer, a producer, or a coordinator of the services offered by the cloud. The benefits of these community clouds are the following: Openness. By removing the dependency on cloud vendors, community clouds are open systems in which fair competition between different solutions can happen.. Community. Being based on a collective that provides resources and services, the infrastructure turns out to be more scalable because the system can grow simply by expanding its user base. Graceful failures. Since there is no single provider or vendor in control of the infrastructure, there is no single point of failure... Convenience and control. Within a community cloud there is no conflict between convenience and control because the cloud is shared and owned by the community, which makes all the decisions through a collective democratic process.. Environmental sustainability. The community cloud is supposed to have a smaller carbon footprint because it harnesses underutilized resources. Moreover, these clouds tend to be more organic by growing and shrinking in a symbiotic relationship to support the demand of the community, which in turn sustains it. This is an alternative vision of a community cloud, focusing more on the social aspect of the clouds that are formed as an aggregation of resources of community members. The idea of a hetero geneous infrastructure built to serve the needs of a community of people is also reflected in the previous definition, but in that case the attention is focused on the commonality of interests that aggregates the users of the cloud into a community. In both cases, the concept of community is fundamental. .Economics of the cloud. The main drivers of cloud computing are economy of scale and simplicity of software delivery and its operation. In fact, the biggest benefit of this phenomenon is financial: the pay-as-you-go model offered by cloud providers. In particular, cloud computing allows:.  Reducing the capital costs associated to the IT infrastructure. Eliminating the depreciation or lifetime costs associated with IT capital assets  Replacing software licensing with subscriptions. Cutting the maintenance and administrative costs of IT resources A capital cost is the cost occurred in purchasing an asset that is useful in the production of goods or the rendering of services. Capital costs are one-time expenses that are generally paid up front and that will contribute over the long term to generate profit. The IT infrastructure and the software are capital assets because enterprises require them to conduct their business. At present it does not matter whether the principal business of an enterprise is related to IT, because the business will definitely have an IT department that is used to automate many of the activities that are performed within the enterprise: payroll, customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, tracking and inventory of products, and others. Hence, IT resources constitute a capital cost \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture expenses that will generate profit over time; more than that, since they are associated with material things they are subject to depreciation over time, which in the end reduces the profit of the enterprise because such costs are directly subtracted from the enterprise revenues. In the case of IT capital costs, the depreciation costs are represented by the loss of value of the hardware over time and the aging of software products that need to be replaced because new features are required. Before cloud computing diffused within the enterprise, the budget spent on IT infrastructure and software constituted a significant expense for medium-sized and large enterprises. Many enterprises own a small or medium-sized datacenter that introduces several operational costs in terms of maintenance, electricity, and cooling. Additional operational costs are occurred in maintaining an IT department and an IT support center. Moreover, other costs are triggered by the purchase of potentially expensive software. With cloud computing these costs are significantly reduced or simply disappear according to its penetration. One of the advantages introduced by the cloud computing model is that it shifts the capital costs previously allocated to the purchase of hardware and software into operational costs inducted by renting the infrastructure and paying subscriptions for the use of software. These costs can be better controlled according to the business needs and prosperity of the enterprise. Cloud computing also introduces reductions in administrative and maintenance costs. That is, there is no or limited need for having administrative staff take care of the management of the cloud infrastructure. At the same time, the cost of IT support staff is also reduced. When it comes to depreciation costs, they simply disappear for the enterprise, since in a scenario where all the IT needs are served by the cloud there are no IT capital assets that depreciate over time. The amount of cost savings that cloud computing can introduce within an enterprise is related to the specific scenario in which cloud services are used and how they contribute to generate a profit for the enterprise. In the case of a small startup, it is possible to completely leverage the cloud for many aspects, such as: .IT infrastructure :Software development CRM and ERP In this case it is possible to completely eliminate capital costs because there are no initial IT assets. The situation is completely different in the case of enterprises that already have a considerable amount of IT assets. In this case, cloud computing, especially IaaS-based solutions, can help manage unplanned capital costs that are generated by the needs of the enterprise in the short term. In this case, by leveraging cloud computing, these costs can be turned into operational costs that last as long as there is a need for them. For example, IT infrastructure leasing helps more efficiently manage peak loads without inducing capital expenses. As soon as the increased load does not justify the use of additional resources, these can be released and the costs associated with them disappear. This is the most adopted model of cloud computing because many enterprises already have IT facilities. Another option is to make a slow transition toward cloud-based solutions while the capital IT assets get depreciated and need to be replaced. Between these two cases there is a wide variety of scenarios in which cloud computing could be of help in generating profits for enterprises. \\n\\n.Open challenges Another important aspect is the elimination of some indirect costs that are generated by IT assets, such as software licensing and support and carbon footprint emissions. With cloud computing, an enterprise uses software applications on a subscription basis, and there is no need for any licensing fee because the software providing the service remains the property of the provider. Leveraging IaaS solutions allows room for datacenter consolidation that in the end could result in a smaller carbon footprint. In some countries such as Australia, the carbon footprint emissions are taxable, so by reducing or completely eliminating such emissions, enterprises can pay less tax. In terms of the pricing models introduced by cloud computing, we can distinguish three different strategies that are adopted by the providers: Tiered pricing. In this model, cloud services are offered in several tiers, each of which offers a fixed computing specification and SLA at a specific price per unit of time. This model is used by Amazon for pricing the ECservice, which makes available different server configurations in terms of computing capacity (CPU type and speed, memory) that have different costs per hour. Per-unit pricing. This model is more suitable to cases where the principal source of revenue for the cloud provider is determined in terms of units of specific services, such as data transfer and memory allocation. In this scenario customers can configure their systems more efficiently according to the application needs. This model is used, for example, by GoGrid, which makes customers pay according to RAM/hour units for the servers deployed in the GoGrid cloud. Subscription-based pricing. This is the model used mostly by SaaS providers in which users pay a periodic subscription fee for use of the software or the specific component services that are integrated in their applications. All of these costs are based on a pay-as-you-go model, which constitutes a more flexible solution for supporting the delivery on demand of IT services. This is what actually makes possible the conversion of IT capital costs into operational costs, since the cost of buying hardware turns into a cost for leasing it and the cost generated by the purchase of software turns into a subscription fee paid for using it. .Open challenges Still in its infancy, cloud computing presents many challenges for industry and academia. There is a significant amount of work in academia focused on defining the challenges brought by this phenomenon [-]. In this section, we highlight the most important ones: the definition and the formalization of cloud computing, the interoperation between different clouds, the creation of standards, security, scalability, fault tolerance, and organizational aspects. ..Cloud definition As discussed earlier, there have been several attempts made to define cloud computing and to pro vide a classification of all the services and technologies identified as such. One of the most comprehensive formalizations is noted in the NIST working definition of cloud computing []. It characterizes cloud computing as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource-pooling. \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture rapid elasticity, and measured service; classifies services as SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS; and categorizes deployment models as public, private, community, and hybrid clouds. The view is in line with our discussion and shared by many IT practitioners and academics. Despite the general agreement on the NIST definition, there are alternative taxonomies for cloud services. David Linthicum, founder of BlueMountains Labs, provides a more detailed classification, which comprehends different classes and better suits the vision of cloud computing within the enterprise. A different approach has been taken at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCsB) [], which departs from the XaaS concept and tries to define an ontology for cloud computing. In their work the concept of a cloud is dissected into five main layers: applications, software environments, software infrastructure, software kernel, and hardware. Each layer addresses the needs of a different class of users within the cloud computing community and most likely builds on the underlying layers. According to the authors, this work constitutes the first effort to provide a more robust interaction model between the different cloud entities on both the functional level and the semantic level.. These characterizations and taxonomies reflect what is meant by cloud computing at the present time, but being in its infancy the phenomenon is constantly evolving, and the same will happen to the attempts to capture the real nature of cloud computing. It is interesting to note that the principal characterization used in this book as a reference for introducing and explaining cloud computing is considered a working definition, which by nature identifies something that continuously changes over time by becoming refined.. ..Cloud interoperability and standards Cloud computing is a service-based model for delivering IT infrastructure and applications like utilities such as power, water, and electricity. To fully realize this goal, introducing standards and allowing interoperability between solutions offered by different vendors are objectives of fundamental importance. Vendor lock-in constitutes one of the major strategic barriers against the seamless adoption of cloud computing at all stages. In particular there is major fear on the part of enterprises in which IT constitutes the significant part of their revenues. Vendor lock-in can prevent a customer from switching to another competitor\\'s solution, or when this is possible, it happens at considerable conversion cost and requires significant amounts of time. This can occur either because the customer wants to find a more suitable solution for customer needs or because the vendor is no longer able to provide the required service. The presence of standards that are actually implemented and adopted in the cloud computing community could give room for interoperability and then lessen the risks resulting from vendor lock-in. The current state of standards and interoperability in cloud computing resembles the early Internet era, when there was no common agreement on the protocols and technologies used and each organization had its own network. Yet the first steps toward a standardization process have been made, and a few organizations, such as the Cloud Computing Interoperability Forum (CCIF), *David Linthicum, Cloud Computing Ontology Framework; http://Cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/. www.Cloudforum.org. \\n\\n.Open challenges. the Open Cloud Consortium,and the DMTF Cloud Standards Incubator,lare leading the path. various stakeholders on the benefits of open standards in the field. The standardization efforts are mostly concerned with the lower level of the cloud computing architecture, which is the most popular and developed. In particular, in the IaaS market, the use of a proprietary virtual machine format constitutes the major reasons for the vendor lock-in, and efforts to provide virtual machine image compatibility between IaaS vendors can possibly improve the level of interoperability among them. The Open Virtualization Format (OVF) [] is an attempt to provide a common format for storing the information and metadata describing a virtual machine image. Even though the OVF provides a full specification for packaging and distributing virtual use it to import static virtual machine images. The challenge is providing standards for supporting the migration of running instances, thus allowing the real ability of switching from one infrastructure vendor to another in a completely transparent manner. Another direction in which standards try to move is devising a general reference architecture for cloud computing systems and providing a standard interface through which one can interact with them. At the moment the compatibility between different solutions is quite restricted, and the lack of a common set of APIs make the interaction with cloud-based solutions vendor specific. In the IaaS market, Amazon Web Services plays a leading role, and other IaaS solutions, mostly open source, provide AWS-compatible APIs, thus constituting themselves as valid alternatives. Even in this case, there is no consistent trend in devising some common APIs for interfacing with IaaS (and, in general, XaaS), and this constitutes one of the areas in which a considerable improvement can be made in the future. ..Scalability and fault tolerance The ability to scale on demand constitutes one of the most attractive features of cloud computing. Clouds allow scaling beyond the limits of the existing in-house IT resources, whether they are infrastructure (compute and storage) or applications services. To implement such a capability, the cloud middleware has to be designed with the principle of scalability along different dimensions in mind-for example, performance, size, and load. The cloud middleware manages a huge number of resource and users, which rely on the cloud to obtain the horsepower that they cannot obtain within the premises without bearing considerable administrative and maintenance costs. These costs are a reality for whomever develops, manages, and maintains the cloud middleware and offers the service to customers. In this scenario, the ability to tolerate failure becomes fundamental, sometimes even more important than providing an extremely efficient and optimized system. Hence, the challenge in this case is designing highly scalable and fault-tolerant systems that are easy to manage and at the same time provide competitive performance. www.opencloudconsortium.org. www.dmtf.org/about/cloud-incubator. www.opencloudmanifesto.org.. \\n\\n Cloud Computing Architecture ..Security, trust, and privacy. Security, trust, and privacy issues are major obstacles for massive adoption of cloud computing The traditional cryptographic technologies are used to prevent data tampering and access to sensitive information. The massive use of virtualization technologies exposes the existing system to new threats, which previously were not considered applicable. For example, it might be possible that applications hosted in the cloud can process sensitive information; such information can be stored within a cloud storage facility using the most advanced technology in cryptography to protect data and then be considered safe from any attempt to access it without the required permissions Although these data are processed in memory, they must necessarily be decrypted by the legitimate application, but since the application is hosted in a managed virtual environment it becomes accessible to the virtual machine manager that by program is designed to access the memory pages of such an application. In this case, what is experienced is a lack of control over the environment in which the application is executed, which is made possible by leveraging the cloud. It then happens that a new way of using existing technologies creates new opportunities for additional threats to the security of applications. The lack of control over their own data and processes also poses severe problems for the trust we give to the cloud service provider and the level of privacy we want to have for our data.. On one side we need to decide whether to trust the provider itself; on the other side, specific regulations can simply prevail over the agreement the provider is willing to establish with us concerning the privacy of the information managed on our behalf. Moreover, cloud services delivered to the end user can be the result of a complex stack of services that are obtained by third parties via the primary cloud service provider. In this case there is a chain of responsibilities in terms of service delivery that can introduce more vulnerability for the secure management of data, the enforcement of privacy rules, and the trust given to the service provider. In particular, when a violation of privacy or illegal access to sensitive information is detected, it could become difficult to identify who is liable for such violations. The challenges in this area are, then, mostly concerned with devising secure and trustable systems from different perspectives: technical, social, and legal. ..Organizational aspects Cloud computing introduces a significant change in the way IT services are consumed and managed. More precisely, storage, compute power, network infrastructure, and applications are delivered as metered services over the Internet. This introduces a billing model that is new within typical enterprise IT departments, which requires a certain level of cultural and organizational process maturity. In particular, a wide acceptance of cloud computing will require a significant change. to business processes and organizational boundaries. Some interesting questions arise in considering the role of the IT department in this new scenario. In particular, the following questions have to be considered: What is the new role of the IT department in an enterprise that completely or significantly relies on the cloud?. How will the compliance department perform its activity when there is a considerable lack of control over application workflows? \\n\\nReview questions What are the implications (political, legal, etc.) for organizations that lose control over some aspects of their services? What will be the perception of the end users of such services?. From an organizational point of view, the lack of control over the management of data and processes poses not only security threats but also new problems that previously did not exist Traditionally, when there was a problem with computer systems, organizations developed strategies and solutions to cope with them, often by relying on local expertise and knowledge. One of the major advantages of moving IT infrastructure and services to the cloud is to reduce or completely remove the costs related to maintenance and support. As a result, users of such infrastructure and services lose a reference to deal with for IT troubleshooting. At the same time, the existing IT staff is required to have a different kind of competency and, in general, fewer skills, thus reducing their value. These are the challenges from an organizational point of view that must be faced and that will significantly change the relationships within the enterprise itself among the various groups of people working together. SUMMARY In this chapter we discussed the fundamental characteristics of cloud computing and introduced reference architecture for classifying and organizing cloud services. To best sum up the content of this chapter, we can recall the NIST working definition of cloud computing, which outlines the fundamental aspects of this phenomenon as follows: Five essential characteristics. In-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling rapid elasticity, and measured service.. Three service models.  Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).  Four deployment models. Public clouds, private clouds, community clouds, and hybrid clouds. The major driving force for rapid adoption of cloud computing are the economics and the simplicity of software delivery and operation. Cloud computing presents considerable opportunity to increase the profits of enterprises by reducing capital costs of IT assets and transforming them into operational costs. For these reasons we have also discussed the economic and cost models introduced with cloud computing. Although cloud computing has been rapidly adopted in industry, there are several open research challenges in areas such as management of cloud computing systems, their security, and social and organizational issues. There is significant room for advancement in software infrastructure and models supporting cloud computing. Review questions . What does the acronym XaaS stand for?. .
