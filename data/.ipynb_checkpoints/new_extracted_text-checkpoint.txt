This page intentionally left blank CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture The term cloud computing is a wide umbrella encompassing many different things lately it has become a buzzword that is easily misused to revamp existing technologies and ideas for the public What makes cloud computing so interesting to IT stakeholders and research practitioners How does it introduce innovation into the field of distributed computing This chapter addresses all these questions and characterizes the phenomenon It provides a reference model that serves as a basis for discussion of cloud computing technologies 4.1Introduction Utilityoriented data centers are the first outcome of cloud computing and they serve as the infra structure through which the services are implemented and delivered Any cloud service whether virtual hardware development platform or application software relies on a distributed sure owned by the provider or rented from a third party As noted in the previous definition the characterization of a cloud is quite general It can be implemented using a a collection of clusters or a heterogeneous distributed system composed of desktop PCs, workstations and her verse Commonly, clouds are built by relying on one or more In most cases hardware resources are visualized to provide isolation of workloads and to best exploit the infrastructure According to the specific service delivered to the end user different layers can be stacked on top of the virtual infrastructure a virtual machine manager a development platform or a specific apply cation As noted in earlier chapters the cloud computing paradigm emerged as a result of the cover fence of various existing models technologies and concepts that changed the way we deliver and use IT services A broad definition of the phenomenon could be as follows Cloud computing is a and Internetcentric way of delivering IT services on demand These services cover the entire computing stack from the hardware infrastructure pack aged as a set of virtual machines to software services such as development platforms and disturb used applications This definition captures the most important and fundamental aspects of cloud computing We now discuss a reference model that aids in categorization of cloud technologies applications and services 111 112 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture 4.2 The cloud reference model Cloud computing supports any IT service that can be consumed as a utility and delivered through a network most likely the Internet. Such characterization includes quite different aspects sure development platforms application and services Architecture It is possible to organize all the concrete realizations of cloud computing into a layered view cover ing the entire stack see Figure from hardware appliances to software systems Cloud resources are harnessed to offer computing horsepower required for providing services Often, this layer is implemented using a metacenter in which hundreds and thousands of nodes are stacked together Cloud infrastructure can be heterogeneous in nature because a variety of resources such as clusters and even networked PCs, can be used to build it Moreover, database systems and other storage services can also be part of the infrastructure The physical infrastructure is managed by the core the objectives of which are to provide an appropriate untie environment for applications and to best utilize resources At the bottom of the stack visualization technologies are used to guarantee untie environment customs nation application isolation and quality of service Hardware visualization is most commonly used at this level Hypervisors manage the pool of resources and expose the distributed infrastructure as a collection of virtual machines By using virtual machine technology it is possible to finely partition the hardware resources such as CPU and memory and to visualize specific devices thus meeting the requirements of users and applications This solution is generally paired PureSaaS Cloud Applications SaaS User Applications Social Computing, Enterprise ISV, ScientificComputing, CDNs PurePaaS Cloud Programming Environment and Tools PaaS Userlevel Web Mashups, Concurrent and Distributed Programming.e Middleware Workflows , Libraries, Scripting laaS Cloud Hosting Platforms laaSM QoS Negotiation, Admission ControlPricing, SLA Management, Monitoring, Execution Management, Metering, Accounting. Core Middleware Virtual Machine VM, VM Management and Deployment Cloud Resources System Infrastructure FIGURE 4.1 The cloud computing architecture 4.2 The cloud reference model 113 with storage and network visualization strategies which allow the infrastructure to be completely visualized and controlled According to the specific service offered to end users other virtuality ton techniques can be used for example visualization helps in creating a portable untie environment where applications can be run and controlled This scenario generally implies that applications hosted in the cloud be developed with a specific technology or a program ming language such as Java, .NET, or Python. In this case the user does not have to build its says them from bare metal Infrastructure management is the key function of core which supports capabilities such as negotiation of the quality of service admission control execution management and monitoring accounting and billing The combination of cloud hosting platforms and resources is generally classified as a InfrastructureasaService IaaS solution We can organize the different examples of IaaS into two categories Some of them provide both the management layer and the physical infrastructure others provide only the management layer IaaS M. In this second case the management layer is often integrated with other IaaS solutions that provide physical infrastructure and adds value to them IaaS solutions are suitable for designing the system infrastructure but provide limited services to build applications Such service is provided by cloud programming environments and tools which form a new layer for offering users a development platform for applications The range of tools include Webbased interfaces commanding tools and frameworks for concurrent and dis tribute programming In this scenario users develop their applications specifically for the cloud by using the API exposed at the For this reason this approach is also known as PlatformasaService PaaS because the service offered to the user is a development platform rather than an infrastructure PaaS solutions generally include the infrastructure as well which is bundled as part of the service provided to users In the case of Pure PaaS, only the mid beware is offered and it has to be complemented with a virtual or physical infrastructure The top layer of the reference model depicted in Figure 4.1 contains services delivered at the application level These are mostly referred to as SoftwareasaService SaaS. In most cases these are Webbased applications that rely on the cloud to provide service to end users The horsepower of the cloud provided by IaaS and PaaS solutions allows independent software vendors to deliver their application services over the Internet. Other applications belonging to this layer are those that strongly leverage the Internet for their core that rely on the cloud to sustain a larger number of users this is the case of gaming portals and in general social networking websites As a vision any service offered in the cloud computing style should be able to adaptively change and expose an autonomic behavior in particular for its availability and performance As a reference model it is then expected to have an adaptive management layer in charge of elastically scaling on demand SaaS implementations should feature such behavior automatically whereas PaaS and IaaS generally provide this functionality as a part of the API exposed to users The reference model described in Figure 4.1 also introduces the concept of everything as a Service XaaS. This is one of the most important elements of cloud computing Cloud services from different providers can be combined to provide a completely integrated solution covering all the computing stack of a system IaaS providers can offer the bare metal in terms of virtual machines where PaaS solutions are deployed When there is no need for a PaaS layer it is possible to directly customize the virtual infrastructure with the software stack needed to run applications This is the case of virtual Web farms a distributed system composed of Web servers database 114 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture. servers and load balancers on top of which prepackaged software is installed to run Web applied tons This possibility has made cloud computing an interesting option for reducing startups capital investment in IT, allowing them to quickly commercialize their ideas and grow their infrastructure according to their revenues Table 4.1 summarizes the characteristics of the three major categories used to classify cloud computing solutions In the following section we briefly discuss these characteristics along with some references to practical implementations Infrastructure and Infrastructure and HardwareasaService IaaSHaaS solutions are the most popular and level oped market segment of cloud computing They deliver customable infrastructure on demand The available options within the IaaS offering umbrella range from single servers to entire infra structures including network devices load balancers and database and Web servers The main technology used to deliver and implement these solutions is hardware visualization one or more virtual machines opportunely configured and interconnected define the distributed says them on top of which applications are installed and deployed Virtual machines also constitute the atomic components that are deployed and priced according to the specific features of the virtual hardware memory number of processors and disk storage IaaSHaaS solutions bring all the been fits of hardware visualization workload partitioning application isolation and hard ware tuning From the perspective of the service provider IaaSHaaS allows better exploiting the IT infrastructure and provides a more secure environment where executing third party applications From the perspective of the customer it reduces the administration and maintenance cost as well as the capital costs allocated to purchase hardware At the same time users can take advantage of the full customization offered by visualization to deploy their infrastructure in the cloud in most cases virtual machines come with only the selected operating system installed and the system can be Table 4.1 Cloud Computing Services Classification.

FIGURE 4.2 InfrastructureasaService reference implementation LAMP is an acronym for Linux Apache MySql and PHP and identifies a specific server configuration running the Linux operating system featuring Apache as Web server MySQL as database server and PHP Hypertext Preprocessor PHP as silverside scripting technology for developing Web applications LAMP stacks are the most common packaged sold tons for quickly deploying Web applications 116 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture generally based on Web 2.0 technologies Web services RESTful APIs, and smashups These teach enologies allow either applications or final users to access the services exposed by the underlying infrastructure Web 2.0 applications allow developing management consoles completely hosted in a browser or a Web page Web services and RESTful APIs allow programs to interact with the service without human intervention thus providing complete integration within a software system The core features of an IaaS solution are implemented in the infrastructure management soft ware layer In particular management of the virtual machines is the most important function performed by this layer A central role is played by the scheduler which is in charge of allocating the execution of virtual machine instances The scheduler interacts with the other components that perform a variety of tasks The pricing and billing component takes care of the cost of executing each virtual machine instance and maintains data that will be used to charge the user The monitoring component tracks the execution of each virtual machine instance and maintains data required for reporting and analyzing the performance of the system The reservation component stores the information of all the virtual machine instances that have been executed or that will be executed in the future If support for QoSbased execution is provided a QoSsLA management component will maintain a repository of all the SLAs made with the users together with the monitoring component this component is used to ensure that a given virtual machine instance is executed with the desired quality of service The VM repository component provides a catalog of virtual machine images that users can use to create virtual instances Some implementations also allow users to upload their specific virtual machine images A VM pool manager component is responsible for keeping track of all the live instances Finally, if the system supports the integration of additional resources belonging to a IaaS provider a provisioning component interacts with the scheduler to provide a virtual machine instance that is external to the local physical infrastructure directly managed by the pool The bottom layer is composed of the physical infrastructure on top of which the management layer operates As previously discussed the infrastructure can be of different types the specific infrastructure used depends on the specific use of the cloud A service provider will most likely use a massive metacenter containing hundreds or thousands of nodes A cloud infrastructure developed in house in a small or enterprise or within a university department will most likely rely on a cluster At the bottom of the scale it is also possible to consider a heterogeneous environ case mostly represents an evolution of desktop grids where any available computing resource such as PCs and workstations that are idle outside of working hours is harnessed to provide a huge com put power From an architectural point of view the physical layer also includes the virtual resources that are rented from external IaaS providers In the case of complete IaaS solutions all three levels are offered as service This is generally the case with public clouds vendors such as Amazon, GoGrid, Joyent, Rightscale, Terremark. Rackspace, ElasticHosts, and Flexiscale, which own large and give access to their com putting infrastructures using an IaaS approach Other solutions instead cover only the user interface 4.2 The cloud reference model 117 and the infrastructure software management layers They need to provide credentials to access IaaS providers or to own a private infrastructure in which the management software is installed This is the case with Enomaly, Elastra, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, and specific IaaS M solutions from VMware, IBM, and Microsoft. The proposed architecture only represents a reference model for IaaS implementations It has been used to provide general insight into the most common features of this approach for providing cloud computing services and the operations commonly implemented at this level Different sold tons can feature additional services or even not provide support for some of the features discussed here Finally, the reference architecture applies to IaaS implementations that provide computing resources especially for the scheduling component If storage is the main service provided it is still possible to distinguish these three layers The role of infrastructure management software is not to keep track and manage the execution of virtual machines but to provide access to large turns and implement storage visualization solutions on top of the physical layer Platform as a service PlatformasaService PaaS solutions provide a development and deployment platform for running applications in the cloud They constitute the on top of which applications are built A general overview of the features characterizing the PaaS approach is given in Figure WebBased Interface Web Services, Portals, REST API.

The first category identifies PaaS implementations that completely follow the cloud computing style for application development and deployment They offer an integrated development environment hosted within the Web browser where applications are designed developed composed and deployed This is the case of Force.com and Longjump. Both deliver as platforms the combination of and infrastructure In the second class we can list all those solutions that are focused on providing a scalable infrastructure for Web application mostly websites In this case developers generally use the providers APIs, which are built on top of industrial runtiest to develop 4.2 The cloud reference model 119 Table 4.2 PlatformasaService Offering Classification Vendors and Category Description Product Type Products PaaSI Runtime environment with Webhosted Middleware Infrastructure Force.com application development platform Rapid Middleware Infrastructure Longjump application prototyping PaaSII Runtime environment for scaling Web Middleware Infrastructure Google AppEngine applications The untie could be Middleware AppScale enhanced by additional components that Middleware Infrastructure Heroku provide scaling capabilities Middleware Infrastructure Engine Yard Middleware Infrastructure Joyent Smart Middleware Platform GigaSpaces XAP PaaSIII Middleware and programming model for Middleware Infrastructure Microsoft Azure developing distributed applications in the Middleware DataSynapse cloud Middleware Cloud IQ Middleware Manjrasof Aneka Middleware Apprenda Middleware SaaSGrid GigaSpaces DataGrid applications Google AppEngine is the most popular product in this category It provides a scalable untie based on the Java and Python programming languages which have been modified for pro hiding a secure untie environment and enriched with additional APIs and components to support scalability AppScale, an implementation of Google AppEngine, provides interface compatible that has to be installed on a physical infrastructure Joyent Smart Platform provides a similar approach to Google AppEngine. A different approach is taken by Heroku and Engine Yard, which provide scalability support for Ruby and Ruby on Railsbased Websites. In this case developers design and create their applications with the traditional methods and then deploy them by uploading to the providers platform The third category consists of all those solutions that provide a cloud programming platform for any kind of application not only Web applications Among these the most popular is Microsoft Windows Azure, which provides a comprehensive framework for building service oriented cloud applications on top of the .NET technology hosted on Microsofts Other solutions in the same category such as Manjrasoft Aneka, Apprenda SaaSGrid, Appistry Cloud IQ Platform, DataSynapse, and GigaSpaces DataGrid, provide only with differ went services Table 4.2 shows only a few options available in the PlatformasaService market segment The PaaS umbrella encompasses a variety of solutions for developing and hosting applications in the cloud Despite this heterogeneity it is possible to identify some criteria that are expected to 120 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture be found in any implementation As noted by Sam Charrington, product manager at Appistry.com, there are some essential characteristics that identify a PaaS solution Runtime framework This framework represents the software stack of the PaaS model and the most intuitive aspect that comes to peoples minds when they refer to PaaS solutions The untie framework executes endure code according to the policies set by the user and the provider Abstraction. PaaS solutions are distinguished by the higher level of abstraction that they provide Whereas in the case of IaaS solutions the focus is on delivering raw access to virtual or physical infrastructure in the case of PaaS the focus is on the applications the cloud must support This means that PaaS solutions offer a way to deploy and manage applications on the cloud rather than a bunch of virtual machines on top of which the IT infrastructure is built and configured Automation. PaaS environments automate the process of deploying applications to the infrastructure scaling them by provisioning additional resources when needed This process is performed automatically and according to the SLA made between the customers and the provider This feature is normally not native in IaaS solutions which only provide ways to provision more resources Cloud services PaaS offerings provide developers and architects with services and APIs. helping them to simplify the creation and delivery of elastic and highly available cloud applications These services are the key differentiators among competing PaaS solutions and generally include specific components for developing applications advanced services for application monitoring management and reporting Another essential component for a PaaSbased approach is the ability to integrate cloud services offered from other vendors by leveraging architecture Such into ration should happen through standard interfaces and protocols This opportunity makes the development of applications more agile and able to evolve according to the needs of customers and users Many of the PaaS offerings provide this facility which is naturally built into the frame work they leverage to provide a cloud computing solution One of the major concerns of leveraging PaaS solutions for implementing applications is vendor locking Differently from IaaS solutions which deliver bare virtual servers that can be fully custom iced in terms of the software stack installed PaaS environments deliver a platform for developing applications which exposes a set of APIs and in most cases binds the application to the specific untie of the PaaS provider Even though a approach strongly simple lies the development and deployment cycle of applications it poses the risk of making these apply cations completely dependent on the provider Such dependency can become a significant obstacle in targeting the application to another environment and untie if the commitments made with the provider cease The impact of the vendor locking on applications obviously varies according to the various solutions Some of them such as Force.com, rely on a proprietary untie framework which makes the targeting process very difficult Others, such as Google AppEngine and Microsoft Azure, rely on aunties but utilize private data storage facilities and 2The full detail of this analysis can be found in the Cloudpulse blog post available at the following address help Cloudpulseblog.com201002theessentialcharacteristicsofpaas. 4.2 The cloud reference model 121 computing infrastructure In this case it is possible to find alternatives based on PaaS solutions implementing the same interfaces with perhaps different performance Others, such as Appistry Cloud IQ Platform, Heroku, and Engine Yard, completely rely on open standards thus making the migration of applications easier Finally, from a financial standpoint although IaaS solutions allow shifting the capital cost into operational costs through outsourcing PaaS solutions can cut the cost across development deploy went and management of applications It helps management reduce the risk of overcharging teach enologies by offloading the cost of upgrading the technology to the PaaS provider This happens transparently for the consumers of this model who can concentrate their effort on the core value of their business The PaaS approach when bundled with underlying IaaS solutions helps even small startup companies quickly offer customers integrated solutions on a hosted platform at a very mini man cost These opportunities make the PaaS offering a viable option that targets different market segments Software as a service SoftwareasaService SaaS is a software delivery model that provides access to applications through the Internet as a Webbased service It provides a means to free users from complex hard ware and software management by offloading such tasks to third parties which build applications accessible to multiple users through a Web browser In this scenario customers neither need install anything on their premises nor have to pay considerable upfront costs to purchase the software and the required licenses They simply access the application website enter their credentials and billing details and can instantly use the application which in most of the cases can be further customized for their needs On the provider side the specific details and features of each customers applied ton are maintained in the infrastructure and made available on demand The SaaS model is appealing for applications serving a wide range of users and that can be adapted to specific needs with little further customization This requirement characterizes SaaS as a software delivery model whereby an application is shared across multiple users This is the case of CRM and ERP applications that constitute common needs for almost all enter priest from small to and large business Every enterprise will have the same requirements for the basic features concerning CRM and ERP; different needs can be satisfied with further customization This scenario facilitates the development of software platforms that provide a general set of features and support specialization and ease of integration of new components Moreover, it constitutes the perfect candidate for hosted solutions since the applications delivered to the user are the same and the applications themselves provide users with the means to shape the 3CRM is an acronym for customer relationship management and identifies concerns related to interactions with custom mess and prospect sales CRM solutions are software systems that simplify the process of managing customers and idea tidying sales strategies 4ERP, an acronym for enterprise resource planning generally refers to an integrated system used to manage internal and external resources including tangible assets materials and financial and human resources ERP software provides an integrated view of the enterprise and facilitates the management of the information flows between business functions and resources 122 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture applications according to user needs As a results SaaS applications are naturally Multitenancy, which is a feature of SaaS compared to traditional packaged software allows prove hers to centralize and sustain the effort of managing large hardware infrastructures maintaining and upgrading applications transparently to the users and optimizing resources by sharing the costs among the large user based On the customer side such costs constitute a minimal fraction of the usage fee paid for the software As noted previously see Section the concept of software as a service preceded cloud com putting starting to circulate at the end of the when it began to gain marketplace acceptance 31. The acronym SaaS was then coined in 2001 by the Software Information Industry Association SIIA 32 with the following connotation In the software as a service model the application or service is deployed from a centralized metacenter across a networkInternet, Intranet, LAN, or VPNproviding access and use on a the applications from a central provider Business models vary according to the level to which the software is streamlined to lower price and increase efficiency or through cuss atomization to further improve digitized business processes The analysis carried out by SIA was mainly oriented to cover application service providers ASPs and all their variations which capture the concept of software applications consumed as a service in a broader sense ASPs already had some of the core characteristics of SaaS . The product sold to customer is application access The application is centrally managed The service delivered is The service delivered is an integrated solution delivered on the contract which means provided as promised Initially ASPs offered hosting solutions for packaged applications which were served to mufti pile customers Successively, other options such as Webbased integration of application services started to gain interest and a new range of opportunities open up to independent software vendors and service providers These opportunities eventually evolved into a more flexible model to deliver applications as a service the SaaS model ASPs provided access to packaged software solutions that addressed the needs of a variety of customers Initially this approach was affordable for service providers but it later became inconvenient when the cost of customizations and special nations increased The SaaS approach introduces a more flexible way of delivering application her vices that are fully customable by the user by integrating new services injecting their own components and designing the application and information Such a new approach has also been possible with the support of Web 2.0 technologies which allowed turning the Web browser into a interface able even to support application composition and development How is cloud computing related to Saas? According to the classification of services shown in Figure the SaaS approach lays on top of the cloud computing stack It fits into the cloud com putting vision expressed by the XaaS acronym EverythingasaService; and with SaaS, applications 4.2 The cloud reference model 123 are delivered as a service Initially the SaaS model was of interest only for lead users and early adopters The benefits delivered at that stage were the following Software cost reduction and total cost of ownership TCO were paramount Servicelevel improvements Rapid implementation Standalone and configurable applications Rudimentary application and data integration Subscription and PAYG pricing With the advent of cloud computing there has been an increasing acceptance of SaaS as a viable software delivery model This led to transition into SaaS 2.0 which does not introduce a new technology but transforms the way in which SaaS is used In particular SaaS 2.0 is focused on providing a more robust infrastructure and application play forms driven by SLAs. Rather than being characterized as a more rapid implementation and deploy went environment SaaS 2.0 will focus on the rapid achievement of business objectives This is why such evolution does not introduce any new technology The existing technologies are com posed together in order to achieve business goals efficiently Fundamental to this perspective is the ability to leverage existing solutions and integrate business services The existing SaaS infrastructures not only allow the development and customization of applications but they also facilitate the integration of services that are exposed by other parties SaaS applications are then the result of the interconnection and the synergy of different applications and components that together provide customers with added value This approach dramatically changes the software ecosystem of the SaaS market which is no longer monopolized by a few vendors but is now a fully intercom netted network of service providers clustered around some big hubs that deliver the application to the customers In this scenario each single component integrated into the SaaS application becomes responsible to the user for ensuring the attached SLA and at the same time could be priced differently Customers can then choose how to specialize their applications by deciding which com parents and services they want to integrated SoftwareasaService applications can serve different needs CRM, ERP, and social networking applications are definitely the most popular ones SalesForce.com is probably the most successful and popular example of a CRM service It provides a wide range of services for applications customer relationship and human resource management enterprise resource planning and many other features SalesForce.com builds on top of the Force.com platform which provides a fully featured environment for building applications It offers either a programming language or a visual environment to arrange components together for building applications In addition to the basic features provided the integral ton with applications enriches SalesForce.coms value In particular through AppExchange customers can publish search and integrate new services and features into their exist ing applications This makes SalesForce.com applications completely extensible and customable Similar solutions are offered by NetSuite and RightNow. NetSuite is an integrated software business suite featuring financial CRM, inventory and commerce integrated all together RightNow is customer SaaS application that integrates together different features from chat to Web communities to support the common activity of an enterprise 124 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture Another important class of popular SaaS applications comprises social networking applications such as Facebook and professional networking sites such as LinkedIn. Other than providing the basic features of networking they allow incorporating and extending their capabilities by integral ing applications These can be developed as plugins for the hosting platform as hap pens for Facebook, and made available to users who can select which applications they want to add to their profile As a results the integrated applications get full access to the network of contacts and users profile data The nature of these applications can be of different types office automation components games or integration with other existing services Office automation applications are also an important representative for SaaS applications Google Documents and Zoho Office are examples of Webbased applications that aim to address all user needs for documents spreadsheets and presentation management They offer a Webbased interface for creating managing and modifying documents that can be easily shared among users and made accessible from anywhere It is important to note the role of SaaS solution enablers which provide an environment in which to integrate services and share information with others A quite successful exam pile is Box.net, an SaaS application providing users with a Web space and profile that can be enriched and extended with applications such as office automation integration with CRMbased solutions social Websites, and photo editing 4.3 Types of clouds Clouds constitute the primary outcome of cloud computing They are a type of parallel and disturb used system harnessing physical and virtual computers presented as a unified computing resources Clouds build the infrastructure on top of which services are implemented and delivered to custom mess Such infrastructures can be of different types and provide useful information about the nature and the services offered by the cloud A more useful classification is given according to the admit isolative domain of a cloud It identifies the boundaries within which cloud computing services are implemented provides hints on the underlying infrastructure adopted to support such services and qualifies them It is then possible to differentiate four different types of cloud Public clouds The cloud is open to the wider public Private clouds The cloud is implemented within the private premises of an institution and generally made accessible to the members of the institution or a subset of them Hybrid or heterogeneous clouds The cloud is a combination of the two previous solutions and most likely identifies a private cloud that has been augmented with resources or services hosted in a public cloud Community clouds The cloud is characterized by a domain involving different deployment models public private and hybrid and it is specifically designed to address the needs of a specific industry Almost all the implementations of clouds can be classified in this categorization In the follow ing sections we provide brief characterizations of these clouds 4.3 Types of clouds 125 Public clouds Public clouds constitute the first expression of cloud computing They are a realization of the canonical view of cloud computing in which the services offered are made available to anyone from anywhere and at any time through the Internet. From a structural point of view they are a dis tribute system most likely composed of one or more connected together on top of which the specific services offered by the cloud are implemented Any customer can easily sign in with the cloud provider enter her credential and billing details and use the services offered Historically, public clouds were the first class of cloud that were implemented and offered They offer solutions for minimizing IT infrastructure costs and serve as a viable option for handling peak loads on the local infrastructure They have become an interesting option for small enterprises which are able to start their businesses without large upfront investments by completely relying on public infrastructure for their IT needs What made attractive public clouds compared to the reshape ing of the private premises and the purchase of hardware and software was the ability to grow or shrink according to the needs of the related business By renting the infrastructure or subscribing to application services customers were able to dynamically upside or downsize their IT according to the demands of their business Currently, public clouds are used both to completely replace the IT infrastructure of enterprises and to extend it when it is required A fundamental characteristic of public clouds is A public cloud is meant to serve a multitude of users not a single customers Any customer requires a virtual computing environment that is separated and most likely isolated from other users This is a fundamental requirement to provide effective monitoring of user activities and guarantee the desired performance and the other QoS attributes negotiated with users QoS management is a very important aspect of public clouds Hence, a significant portion of the software infrastructure is devoted to monitoring the cloud resources to bill them according to the contract made with the user and to keep a complete history of cloud usage for each customers These features are fundamental to public clouds because they help providers offer services to users with full accountability A public cloud can offer any kind of service infrastructure platform or applications For example Amazon EC2 is a public cloud that provides infrastructure as a service Google AppEngine is a public cloud that provides an application development platform as a service and SalesForce.com is a public cloud that provides software as a service What makes public clouds peculiar is the way they are con sued They are available to everyone and are generally architect to support a large quantity of users What characterizes them is their natural ability to scale on demand and sustain peak loads From an architectural point of view there is no restriction concerning the type of distributed says them implemented to support public clouds Most likely one or more constitute the physical infrastructure on top of which the services are implemented and delivered Public clouds can be composed of geographically dispersed to share the load of users and better serve them according to their locations For example Amazon Web Services has installed in the United States, Europe, Singapore, and Australia; they allow their customers to choose between three different regions or Such regions are priced differently and are further divided into availability zones which map to specific According to the she civic class of services delivered by the cloud a different software stack is installed to manage the infrastructure virtual machine managers distributed or distributed applications 126 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture Private clouds Public clouds are appealing and provide a viable option to cut IT costs and reduce capital expenses but they are not applicable in all scenarios For example a very common critique to the use of cloud computing in its canonical implementation is the loss of control In the case of public clouds the provider is in control of the infrastructure and eventually of the customers core logic and sen positive data Even though there could be regulatory procedure in place that guarantees fair manage went and respect of the customers privacy this condition can still be perceived as a threat or as an unacceptable risk that some organizations are not willing to take In particular institutions such as government and military agencies will not consider public clouds as an option for processing or storing their sensitive data The risk of a breach in the security infrastructure of the provider could expose such information to others this could simply be considered unacceptable In other cases the loss of control of where your virtual IT infrastructure resides could open the way to other problematic situations More precisely the geographical location of a metacenter gen really determines the regulations that are applied to management of digital information As a results according to the specific location of data some sensitive information can be made accessible to government agencies or even considered outside the law if processed with specific cryptographic techniques For example the USA PATRIOT Act provides its government and other agencies with virtually limitless powers to access information including that belonging to any company that stores information in the U.S. territory Finally, existing enterprises that have large computing infra structures or large installed bases of software do not simply want to switch to public clouds but they use the existing IT resources and optimize their revenue All these aspects make the use of a public computing infrastructure not always possible Yet the general idea supported by the cloud computing vision can still be attractive More specifically having an infrastructure able to deliver IT services on demand can still be a winning solution even when implemented within the private premises of an institution This idea led to the diffusion of private clouds which are similar to pub lie clouds but their model is limited within the boundaries of an Organization. Private clouds are virtual distributed systems that rely on a private infrastructure and provide internal users with dynamic provisioning of computing resources Instead of a model as in public clouds there could be other schemes in place taking into account the usage of the cloud and proportionally billing the different departments or sections of an enterprise Private clouds have the advantage of keeping the core business operations unhouse by relying on the exist ing IT infrastructure and reducing the burden of maintaining it once the cloud has been set up In this scenario security concerns are less critical since sensitive information does not flow out of the private infrastructure Moreover, existing IT resources can be better utilized because the private cloud can provide services to a different range of users Another interesting opportunity that comes with private clouds is the possibility of testing applications and systems at a comparatively lower 5The USA PATRIOT Act is a statute enacted by the U.S. government that increases the ability of law enforcement age lies to search telephone email medical financial and other records and eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gather ing within the United States. The full text of the act is available at the Website of the Library of the Congress at the following address accessed April 2010 4.3 Types of clouds 127 price rather than public clouds before deploying them on the public virtual infrastructure A Forrester report 34 on the benefits of delivering unhouse cloud computing solutions for enter prices highlighted some of the key advantages of using a private cloud computing infrastructure Customer information protection Despite assurances by the public cloud leaders about security few provide satisfactory disclosure or have long enough histories with their cloud offerings to provide warranties about the specific level of security put in place on their systems Inhouse security is easier to maintain and rely on Infrastructure ensuring SLAs. Quality of service implies specific operations such as appropriate clustering and data replication system monitoring and maintenance and disaster recovery and other optime services can be commensurate to the application needs Although public cloud vendors provide some of these features not all of them are available as needed Compliance with standard procedures and operations If organizations are subject to compliance standards specific procedures have to be put in place when deploying and executing applications This could be not possible in the case of the virtual public infrastructure All these aspects make the use of infrastructures in private premises an interesting Option. From an architectural point of view private clouds can be implemented on more heterogeneous hardware They generally rely on the existing IT infrastructure already deployed on the private prep miss This could be a a cluster an enterprise desktop grid or a combination of them The physical layer is complemented with infrastructure management software IaaS M; see Section or a PaaS solution according to the service delivered to the users of the cloud Different options can be adopted to implement private clouds Figure 4.4 provides a compare pensive view of the solutions together with some reference to the most popular software used to deploy private clouds At the bottom layer of the software stack virtual machine technologies such as Xen KVM and VMware serve as the foundations of the cloud Virtual machine management technologies such as VMware vCloud, Eucalyptus and OpenNebula 38 can be used to control the virtual infrastructure and provide an IaaS solution VMware vCloud is a proprietary solution but Eucalyptus provides full compatibility with Amazon Web Services interfaces and supports different virtual machine technologies such as Xen, KVM, and VMware. Like Eucalyptus, OpenNebula is an solution for virtual infrastructure man agent that supports KVM, Xen, and VMware, which has been designed to easily integrate IaaS providers Its modular architecture allows extending the software with additional features such as the capability of reserving virtual machine instances by using Haizea 39 as scheduler Solutions that rely on the previous virtual machine managers and provide added value are OpenPEX 40 and InterGrid 41. OpenPEX is Webbased system that allows the reservation of virtual machine instances and is designed to support different back ends at the moment only the support for Xen is implemented InterGrid provides added value on top of OpenNebula and Amazon EC2 by allowing the reservation of virtual machine instances and managing mufti administrative domain clouds PaaS solutions can provide an additional layer and deliver a high level service for private clouds Among the options available for private deployment of clouds we can consider DataSynapse, Zimory Pools, Elastra, and Aneka. DataSynapse is a global provider of application visualization software By relying on the VMware visualization technology 128 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture PlatformasaService Solutions DataSynapse, Zimory Pools, PaaS Elastra CloudServer, Aneka, laaS Infrastructure Management Software Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, VMWare vCloud, OpenPEX, InterGrid, S we Virtual Machine Technology KVM, Xen, VMWare, Datacenters, Clusters, Desktop Grids Physical Infrastructure. FIGURE 4.4 Private clouds hardware and software stack DataSynapse provides a flexible environment for building private clouds on top of Elastra Cloud Server is a platform for easily configuring and deploying distributed application infrastructures on clouds Zimory provides a software infrastructure layer that automates the use of resource pools based on Xen, KVM, and VMware visualization technologies It allows creating an internal cloud composed of sparse private and public resources and provides facilities for migrating applications within the existing infrastructure Aneka is a software development platform that can be used to deploy a cloud infrastructure on top of heterogeneous hardware clusters and desktop grids It provides a plumbable architecture that mainly devoted to supporting the execution of distributed applications with different programming models bag of tasks MapReduce, and others Private clouds can provide unhouse solutions for cloud computing but if compared to public clouds they exhibit more limited capability to scale elastically on demand Hybrid clouds Public clouds are large software and hardware infrastructures that have a capability that is huge enough to serve the needs of multiple users but they suffer from security threats and administer give pitfalls Although the option of completely relying on a public virtual infrastructure is appeal ing for companies that did not incur IT capital costs and have just started considering their IT needs startups in most cases the private cloud option prevails because of the existing IT infrastructure 4.3 Types of clouds 129 Private clouds are the perfect solution when it is necessary to keep the processing of inform ton within an enterprises premises or it is necessary to use the existing hardware and software infrastructure One of the major drawbacks of private deployments is the inability to scale on demand and to efficiently address peak loads In this case it is important to leverage capabilities of public clouds as needed Hence, a hybrid solution could be an interesting opportunity for taking advantage of the best of the private and public worlds This led to the development and diffusion of hybrid clouds Hybrid clouds allow enterprises to exploit existing IT infrastructures maintain sensitive inform nation within the premises and naturally grow and shrink by provisioning external resources and releasing them when there no longer needed Security concerns are then only limited to the public portion of the cloud that can be used to perform operations with less stringent constraints but that are still part of the system workload Figure 4.5 provides a general overview of a hybrid cloud It is a heterogeneous distributed system resulting from a private cloud that integrates additional services or resources from one or more public clouds For this reason they are also called heterogeneous clouds As depicted in the diagram dynamic provisioning is a fundamental component in this she nation Hybrid clouds address scalability issues by leveraging external resources for exceeding Hybrid Heterogeneous Cloud Public Cloud Private Cloud Paas Dynamic Provisioning laaSM Public Cloud Datacenter Cluster Desktop Grids NOWs FIGURE 4.5 Hybridheterogeneous cloud overview 130 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture capacity demand These resources or services are temporarily leased for the time required and then released This practice is also known as Whereas the concept of hybrid cloud is general it mostly applies to IT infrastructure rather than software services Serviceoriented computing already introduces the concept of integration of paid software services with existing application deployed in the private premises In an IaaS scenario dynamic provisioning refers to the ability to acquire on demand virtual machines in order to increase the capability of the resulting distributed system and then release them Infrastructure man agent software and PaaS solutions are the building blocks for deploying and managing hybrid clouds In particular with respect to private clouds dynamic provisioning introduces a more com plea scheduling algorithm and policies the goal of which is also to optimize the budget spent to rent public resources Infrastructure management software such as OpenNebula already exposes the capability of into grating resources from public clouds such as Amazon EC2. In this case the virtual machine obtained from the public infrastructure is managed as all the other virtual machine instances main trained locally What is missing is then an advanced scheduling engine that able to differentiate these resources and provide smart allocations by taking into account the budget available to extend the existing infrastructure In the case of OpenNebula, advanced schedulers such as Haizea can be integrated to provide scheduling A different approach is taken by InterGrid. This is essentially a distributed scheduling engine that manages the allocation of virtual machines in a col lection of peer networks Such networks can be represented by a local cluster a gateway to a public cloud or a combination of the two Once a request is submitted to one of the InterGrid gateways it is served by possibly allocating virtual instances in all the peered networks and the allocation of requests is performed by taking into account the user budget and the peering arrangements between networks Dynamic provisioning is most commonly implemented in PaaS solutions that support hybrid clouds As previously discussed one of the fundamental components of PaaS is the mapping of distributed applications onto the cloud infrastructure In this scenario the role of dynamic provisioning becomes fundamental to ensuring the execution of applications under the QoS agreed on with the user For example Aneka provides a provisioning service that leverages different IaaS providers for scaling the existing cloud infrastructure 42. The provisioning service cooperates with the scheduler which is in charge of guaranteeing a specific QoS for applications In particular each user application has a budget attached and the scheduler uses that budget to optimize the execution of the application by renting virtual nodes if needed Other PaaS implement nations support the deployment of hybrid clouds and provide dynamic provisioning capabilities Among those discussed for the implementation and management of private clouds we can cite Elastra CloudServer and Zimory Pools. 6According to the Cloud Computing Wiki, the term cloudburst has a double meaning it also refers to the failure of a cloud computing environment due to the inability to handle a spike in demand CloudcomputingwikiHomeCloudcomputingvocabulary. In this book we always refer to the dynamic provisioning of resources from public clouds when mentioning this terms 4.3 Types of clouds 131 Community Cloud Infrastructure Application Services ThirdParty Cloud Public Cloud Development Private Cloud Platforms Public Cloud Private Cloud Federal and Government Bodies Private Users Industries Enterprises Public Services FIGURE 4.6 A community cloud Community clouds Community clouds are distributed systems created by integrating the services of different clouds to address the specific needs of an industry a community or a business sector The National Institute of Standards and Technologies NIST 43 characterizes community clouds as follows The infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premise or off premises Figure 4.6 provides a general view of the usage scenario of community clouds together with reference architecture The users of a specific community cloud fall into a comma city sharing the same concerns or needs they can be government bodies industries or even simple users but all of them focus on the same issues for their interaction with the cloud This is a differ went scenario than public clouds which serve a multitude of users with different needs Community clouds are also different from private clouds where the services are generally delivered within the institution that owns the cloud From an architectural point of view a community cloud is most likely implemented over mufti pile administrative domains This means that different organizations such as government bodies 132 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture private enterprises research organizations and even public virtual infrastructure providers control ute with their resources to build the cloud infrastructure Candidate sectors for community clouds are as follows Media industry In the media industry companies are looking for agile and simple solutions to improve the efficiency of content production Most media productions involve an extended ecosystem of partners In particular the creation of digital content is the outcome of a collaborative process that includes movement of large data massive rendering tasks and complex executions Community clouds can provide a shared environment where services can facilitate collaboration and offer the media production Healthcare industry In the healthcare industry there are different scenarios in which community clouds could be of used In particular community clouds can provide a global platform on which to share information and knowledge without revealing sensitive data maintained within the private infrastructure The naturally hybrid deployment model of community clouds can easily support the storing of data in a private cloud while using the shared infrastructure for noncritical services and automating processes within hospitals Energy and other core industries In these sectors community clouds can bundle the comprehensive set of solutions that together vertically address management deployment and orchestration of services and operations Since these industries involve different providers create an open and fair market Public sector Legal and political restrictions in the public sector can limit the adoption of public cloud offerings Moreover, governmental processes involve several institutions and agencies and are aimed at providing strategic solutions at local national and international administrative levels They involve and possibly processes Some examples include invoice approval infrastructure planning and public hearings A community cloud can constitute the optimal venue to provide a distributed environment in which to create a communication platform for performing such operations Scientific research Science clouds are an interesting example of community clouds In this case the common interest driving different organizations sharing a large distributed infrastructure is scientific computing The term community cloud can also identify a more specific type of cloud that arises from con corn over the controls of vendors in cloud computing and that aspire to combine the principles of digital ecosystems 44 with the case study of cloud computing A community cloud is formed by harnessing the underutilized resources of user machines 45 and providing an infrastructure in Digital ecosystems are distributed adaptive and open systems with properties of seal ability and sustainability inspired by natural ecosystems The primary aim of digital ecosystems is to sustain the regional development of small and enterprises SMEs. 4.4 Economics of the cloud 133 which each can be at the same time a consumer a producer or a coordinator of the services offered by the cloud The benefits of these community clouds are the following Openness. By removing the dependency on cloud vendors community clouds are open systems in which fair competition between different solutions can happened Community. Being based on a collective that provides resources and services the infrastructure turns out to be more scalable because the system can grow simply by expanding its user based Graceful failures Since there is no single provider or vendor in control of the infrastructure there is no single point of Convenience and control Within a community cloud there is no conflict between convenience and control because the cloud is shared and owned by the community which makes all the decisions through a collective democratic process Environmental sustainability The community cloud is supposed to have a smaller carbon footprint because it harnesses underutilized resources Moreover, these clouds tend to be more organic by growing and shrinking in a symbiotic relationship to support the demand of the community which in turn sustains it This is an alternative vision of a community cloud focusing more on the social aspect of the clouds that are formed as an aggregation of resources of community members The idea of a hetero generous infrastructure built to serve the needs of a community of people is also reflected in the are virus definition but in that case the attention is focused on the commonality of interests that aggregates the users of the cloud into a community In both cases the concept of community is fundamental 4.4 Economics of the cloud The main drivers of cloud computing are economy of scale and simplicity of software delivery and its operation In fact the biggest benefit of this phenomenon is financial the model offered by cloud providers In particular cloud computing allows Reducing the capital costs associated to the IT infrastructure Eliminating the depreciation or lifetime costs associated with IT capital assets Replacing software licensing with subscriptions Cutting the maintenance and administrative costs of IT resources A capital cost is the cost occurred in purchasing an asset that is useful in the production of goods or the rendering of services Capital costs are onetime expenses that are generally paid up front and that will contribute over the long term to generate profit The IT infrastructure and the software are capital assets because enterprises require them to conduct their business At present it does not matter whether the principal business of an enterprise is related to IT, because the business will definitely have an IT department that is used to automate many of the activities that are per formed within the enterprise payroll customer relationship management enterprise resource plan sing tracking and inventory of products and others Hence, IT resources constitute a capital cost 134 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture expenses that will generate profit over time more than that since they are associated with material things they are subject to depreciation over time which in the end reduces the profit of the enterprise because such costs are directly subtracted from the enterprise revenues In the case of IT capital costs the depreciation costs are represented by the loss of value of the hardware over time and the aging of software products that need to be replaced because new features are required Before cloud computing diffused within the enterprise the budget spent on IT infrastructure and software constituted a significant expense for and large enterprises Many enterprises own a small or metacenter that introduces several operational costs in terms of main penance electricity and cooling Additional operational costs are occurred in maintaining an IT department and an IT support center Moreover, other costs are triggered by the purchase of potentially expensive software With cloud computing these costs are significantly reduced or him ply disappear according to its penetration One of the advantages introduced by the cloud compute ing model is that it shifts the capital costs previously allocated to the purchase of hardware and software into operational costs inducted by renting the infrastructure and paying subscriptions for the use of software These costs can be better controlled according to the business needs and pros purity of the enterprise Cloud computing also introduces reductions in administrative and maine nance costs That is there is no or limited need for having administrative staff take care of the management of the cloud infrastructure At the same time the cost of IT support staff is also reduced When it comes to depreciation costs they simply disappear for the enterprise since in a scenario where all the IT needs are served by the cloud there are no IT capital assets that depreciate over time The amount of cost savings that cloud computing can introduce within an enterprise is related to the specific scenario in which cloud services are used and how they contribute to generate a profit for the enterprise In the case of a small startup it is possible to completely leverage the cloud for many aspects such as .IT infrastructure Software development CRM and ERP In this case it is possible to completely eliminate capital costs because there are no initial IT assets The situation is completely different in the case of enterprises that already have a consider able amount of IT assets In this case cloud computing especially IaaSbased solutions can help manage unplanned capital costs that are generated by the needs of the enterprise in the short terms In this case by leveraging cloud computing these costs can be turned into operational costs that last as long as there is a need for them For example IT infrastructure leasing helps more eff gently manage peak loads without inducing capital expenses As soon as the increased load does not justify the use of additional resources these can be released and the costs associated with them disappear This is the most adopted model of cloud computing because many enterprises already have IT facilities Another option is to make a slow transition toward solutions while the capital IT assets get depreciated and need to be replaced Between these two cases there is a wide variety of scenarios in which cloud computing could be of help in generating profits for enterprises 4.5 Open challenges 135 Another important aspect is the elimination of some indirect costs that are generated by IT assets such as software licensing and support and carbon footprint emissions With cloud compute ing an enterprise uses software applications on a subscription basis and there is no need for any licensing fee because the software providing the service remains the property of the provider Leveraging IaaS solutions allows room for metacenter consolidation that in the end could result in a smaller carbon footprints In some countries such as Australia, the carbon footprint emissions are taxable so by reducing or completely eliminating such emissions enterprises can pay less tax In terms of the pricing models introduced by cloud computing we can distinguish three differ went strategies that are adopted by the providers Tiered pricing In this model cloud services are offered in several tiers each of which offers a fixed computing specification and SLA at a specific price per unit of time This model is used by Amazon for pricing the EC2 service which makes available different server configurations in terms of computing capacity CPU type and speed memory that have different costs per hours Perunit pricing This model is more suitable to cases where the principal source of revenue for the cloud provider is determined in terms of units of specific services such as data transfer and memory allocation In this scenario customers can configure their systems more efficiently according to the application needs This model is used for example by GoGrid, which makes customers pay according to RAMhour units for the servers deployed in the GoGrid cloud Subscriptionbased pricing This is the model used mostly by SaaS providers in which users pay a periodic subscription fee for use of the software or the specific component services that are integrated in their applications All of these costs are based on a model which constitutes a more flexible sold ton for supporting the delivery on demand of IT services This is what actually makes possible the conversion of IT capital costs into operational costs since the cost of buying hardware turns into a cost for leasing it and the cost generated by the purchase of software turns into a subscription fee paid for using it 4.5 Open challenges Still in its infancy cloud computing presents many challenges for industry and academia There is a significant amount of work in academia focused on defining the challenges brought by this the noumenon 4649. In this section we highlight the most important ones the definition and the for realization of cloud computing the between different clouds the creation of standards security scalability fault tolerance and organizational aspects Cloud definition As discussed earlier there have been several attempts made to define cloud computing and to pro vide a classification of all the services and technologies identified as such One of the most com prehensile formalizations is noted in the NIST working definition of cloud computing 43. It characterizes cloud computing as demand broad network access 136 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture rapid elasticity and measured service classifies services as SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS; and categorizes deployment models as public private community and hybrid clouds The view is in line with our discussion and shared by many IT practitioners and academics Despite the general agreement on the NIST definition there are alternative taxonomies for cloud services David Linthicum, founder of BlueMountains Labs, provides a more detailed classified tiny which comprehends 10 different classes and better suits the vision of cloud computing within the enterprise A different approach has been taken at the University of California, Santa Barbara UCsB which departs from the XaaS concept and tries to define an ontology for cloud com putting In their work the concept of a cloud is dissected into five main layers applications soft ware environments software infrastructure software kernel and hardware Each layer addresses the needs of a different class of users within the cloud computing community and most likely builds on the underlying layers According to the authors this work constitutes the first effort to provide a more robust interaction model between the different cloud entities on both the functional level and the semantic level These characterizations and taxonomies reflect what is meant by cloud computing at the present time but being in its infancy the phenomenon is constantly evolving and the same will happen to the attempts to capture the real nature of cloud computing It is interesting to note that the principal characterization used in this book as a reference for introducing and explaining cloud computing is considered a working definition which by nature identifies something that continuously changes over time by becoming refined Cloud interoperability and standards Cloud computing is a model for delivering IT infrastructure and applications like until cities such as power water and electricity To fully realize this goal introducing standards and allowing interoperability between solutions offered by different vendors are objectives of fund mental importance Vendor locking constitutes one of the major strategic barriers against the seam less adoption of cloud computing at all stages In particular there is major fear on the part of enterprises in which IT constitutes the significant part of their revenues Vendor locking can prevent a customer from switching to another competitors solution or when this is possible it happens at considerable conversion cost and requires significant amounts of time This can occur either because the customer wants to find a more suitable solution for customer needs or because the ven dor is no longer able to provide the required service The presence of standards that are actually implemented and adopted in the cloud computing community could give room for interoperability and then lessen the risks resulting from vendor locking The current state of standards and interoperability in cloud computing resembles the early Internet era when there was no common agreement on the protocols and technologies used and each organization had its own network Yet the first steps toward a standardization process have been made and a few organizations such as the Cloud Computing Interoperability Forum CCIF, David Linthicum, Cloud Computing Ontology Framework; httpCloudcomputing.syscon.comnode811519. 9www.Cloudforum.org. 4.5 Open challenges 137 the Open Cloud Consortium,1 and the DMTF Cloud Standards Incubator,l1 are leading the path various stakeholders on the benefits of open standards in the field The standardization efforts are mostly concerned with the lower level of the cloud computing architecture which is the most popular and developed In particular in the IaaS market the use of a proprietary virtual machine format constitutes the major reasons for the vendor locking and efforts to provide virtual machine image compatibility between IaaS vendors can possibly improve the level of interoperability among them The Open Virtualization Format OVF 51 is an attempt to provide a common format for storing the information and describing a virtual machine image Even though the OVF provides a full specification for packaging and distributing virtual use it to import static virtual machine images The challenge is providing standards for supporting the migration of running instances thus allowing the real ability of switching from one sure vendor to another in a completely transparent manner Another direction in which standards try to move is devising a general reference architecture for cloud computing systems and providing a standard interface through which one can interact with them At the moment the compatibility between different solutions is quite restricted and the lack of a common set of APIs make the interaction with solutions vendor specific In the IaaS market Amazon Web Services plays a leading role and other IaaS solutions mostly open source provide AWScompatible APIs, thus constituting themselves as valid alternatives Even in this case there is no consistent trend in devising some common APIs for interfacing with IaaS and in general XaaS, and this constitutes one of the areas in which a considerable improvement can be made in the future Scalability and fault tolerance The ability to scale on demand constitutes one of the most attractive features of cloud computing Clouds allow scaling beyond the limits of the existing unhouse IT resources whether they are infrastructure compute and storage or applications services To implement such a capability the cloud has to be designed with the principle of scalability along different dimensions in minor example performance size and load The cloud manages a huge number of resource and users which rely on the cloud to obtain the horsepower that they cannot obtain within the premises without bearing considerable administrative and maintenance costs These costs are a reality for whomever develops manages and maintains the cloud and offers the service to customers In this scenario the ability to tolerate failure becomes fundamental sometimes even more important than providing an extremely efficient and optimized system Hence, the challenge in this case is designing highly scalable and systems that are easy to manage and at the same time provide competitive performance 138 CHAPTER 4 Cloud Computing Architecture Security, trust and privacy Security, trust and privacy issues are major obstacles for massive adoption of cloud computing The traditional cryptographic technologies are used to prevent data tampering and access to sense give information The massive use of visualization technologies exposes the existing system to new threats which previously were not considered applicable For example it might be possible that applications hosted in the cloud can process sensitive information such information can be stored within a cloud storage facility using the most advanced technology in cryptography to protect data and then be considered safe from any attempt to access it without the required permissions Although these data are processed in memory they must necessarily be decrypted by the legitimate application but since the application is hosted in a managed virtual environment it becomes access bible to the virtual machine manager that by program is designed to access the memory pages of such an application In this case what is experienced is a lack of control over the environment in which the application is executed which is made possible by leveraging the cloud It then happens that a new way of using existing technologies creates new opportunities for additional threats to the security of applications The lack of control over their own data and processes also poses severe problems for the trust we give to the cloud service provider and the level of privacy we want to have for our data On one side we need to decide whether to trust the provider itself on the other side specific regulations can simply prevail over the agreement the provider is willing to establish with us con corning the privacy of the information managed on our behalf Moreover, cloud services delivered to the end user can be the result of a complex stack of services that are obtained by third parties via the primary cloud service provider In this case there is a chain of responsibilities in terms of service delivery that can introduce more vulnerability for the secure management of data the enforcement of privacy rules and the trust given to the service provider In particular when a via nation of privacy or illegal access to sensitive information is detected it could become difficult to identify who is liable for such violations The challenges in this area are then mostly concerned with devising secure and treatable systems from different perspectives technical social and legal Organizational aspects Cloud computing introduces a significant change in the way IT services are consumed and man aged More precisely storage compute power network infrastructure and applications are deli red as metered services over the Internet. This introduces a billing model that is new within typical enterprise IT departments which requires a certain level of cultural and organizational pro cess maturity In particular a wide acceptance of cloud computing will require a significant change to business processes and organizational boundaries Some interesting questions arise in considering the role of the IT department in this new scenario In particular the following questions have to be considered What is the new role of the IT department in an enterprise that completely or significantly relies on the cloud How will the compliance department perform its activity when there is a considerable lack of control over application Review questions 139 What are the implications political legal etch for organizations that lose control over some aspects of their services What will be the perception of the end users of such services From an organizational point of view the lack of control over the management of data and pro messes poses not only security threats but also new problems that previously did not exist Traditionally, when there was a problem with computer systems organizations developed strategies and solutions to cope with them often by relying on local expertise and knowledge One of the major advantages of moving IT infrastructure and services to the cloud is to reduce or completely remove the costs related to maintenance and support As a results users of such infrastructure and services lose a reference to deal with for IT troubleshooting At the same time the existing IT staff is required to have a different kind of competency and in general fewer skills thus reducing their value These are the challenges from an organizational point of view that must be faced and that will significantly change the relationships within the enterprise itself among the various groups of people working together SUMMARY In this chapter we discussed the fundamental characteristics of cloud computing and introduced ref terence architecture for classifying and organizing cloud services To best sum up the content of this chapter we can recall the NIST working definition of cloud computing which outlines the fund mental aspects of this phenomenon as follows Five essential characteristics Indemand broad network access resource pooling rapid elasticity and measured service Three service models SoftwareasaService SaaS, PlatformasaService PaaS, and InfrastructureasaService IaaS. Four deployment models Public clouds private clouds community clouds and hybrid clouds The major driving force for rapid adoption of cloud computing are the economics and the him publicity of software delivery and operation Cloud computing presents considerable opportunity to increase the profits of enterprises by reducing capital costs of IT assets and transforming them into operational costs For these reasons we have also discussed the economic and cost models into ducked with cloud computing Although cloud computing has been rapidly adopted in industry there are several open research challenges in areas such as management of cloud computing systems their security and social and organizational issues There is significant room for advancement in software infrastructure and models supporting cloud computing Review questions 1.
